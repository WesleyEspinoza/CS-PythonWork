2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.

26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.

31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.

13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.

26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.

7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.

11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?

14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made.

17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.

5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.
Find more refined stories of lust at MyErotica.com.My Master had taken me out to a pretentious event earlier that evening. Now, back at his place, we could finally be ourselves. His dungeon was my palace and I was his princess.
I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.

5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.
Find more refined stories of lust at MyErotica.com.My Master had taken me out to a pretentious event earlier that evening. Now, back at his place, we could finally be ourselves. His dungeon was my palace and I was his princess.
I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.
Follow MyErotica for refined erotic fiction to ignite your deepest desires.Shallow breaths
As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
He2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.
Find more refined stories of lust at MyErotica.com.My Master had taken me out to a pretentious event earlier that evening. Now, back at his place, we could finally be ourselves. His dungeon was my palace and I was his princess.
I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.
Follow MyErotica for refined erotic fiction to ignite your deepest desires.Shallow breaths
As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
HeThe first time, I was pretty sure I was seeing things. I was in my towel, fresh out the shower, ready to pick my undies before heading out for my uni class in town. Deciding what to wear, I had this vague, mostly subconscious sense that my bras and panties weren’t quite laid out how they were the previous morning.
The second time, I was convinced someone had been in my panty drawer. Some of my panties and thongs we definitely not arranged how I’d left them.
I felt pissed. Which of my housemates was going through my personal stuff? There were five of us living together. Two girls, three guys. None of them seemed the sort who’d go through my lingerie. Then again: how would I know?
The third time I caught him. Sat on my bed, with my favorite black lace panties wrapped around his cock. He was pumping himself hard and fast.
“What the fuck, James?” I said angrily, turning on the light.
“Shit,” was all he managed. And then again: “Shit.”
I’ve never seen anyone look so panicked. Deer in the headlights didn’t come close to it.
He took my panties off his cock, left them on my bed, and zipped himself back up. Then, unable to look me in the eyes, he walked straight past me, head down, and up to his top floor bedroom.
Two hours later I was lying in bed, unable to sleep.
The anger had subsided. Bizarrely, the initial feelings of violation had now turned to intrigue.
I’d never thought of any of my housemates as anything but friends. And now suddenly I couldn’t help but think about James differently.
He was into me.
My thoughts lingered for a moment on seeing his cock.
Out of nowhere, I felt a slight shudder of pleasure go through me thinking about my sexiest panties wrapped around it. Without even realizing, my hand had slipped down between my legs.
What was I thinking? I was shocked at myself. I wanted to feel angry again. That was the normal response I should be having. Right? But I couldn’t get the anger back. Suddenly the whole thing felt thrilling.
Before I could stop myself, I picked up my phone. And I texted him.
“Next time, just ask, okay?”
My heart was racing. What was I doing? I felt instant regret.
Then I heard my phone beep.
“Next time?”
Out of nowhere I felt this longing to see his cock again. With my panties wrapped around it. I wanted to watch him do it.
“How about now?” I wrote impulsively.
“?” he replied instantly.
Did I really want to do this? What was I getting myself into?
Fuck it, I thought.
“Come down and play with my panties again…while I watch,” I texted.
My left hand was rubbing my clit through my panties as I typed on the phone with my right. I hadn’t felt turned on like this in ages. Maybe never quite like this.
My phone beeped again.
“Are you serious?”
I found myself getting almost annoyed at his hesitancy, firing off an instant reply.
“Yes! Now get the fuck down here already.”
I heard the floorboards creak. His room was directly above mine. And then his slow footsteps down the stairs. He knocked gently on my door. Walked in, smiling sheepishly.
He didn’t know what to say.
“I want to watch you jerk off in my panties,” I told him, suddenly feeling bold in a way that surprised me.
I lifted the bedcover off and moved so I was sitting on top of it instead. I indicated for him to come and sit next to me. He was still fully dressed and clearly nervous. I found it quite endearing. And it made me want to take charge like I never had before.
“Take your jeans and boxers off,” I told him.
He could hardly look at me, but did it immediately. I smiled when I saw his cock. So big and hard. Maybe he was nervous, but he was as turned on as I was.
“Now take my panties off for me.”
He looked at me, stunned. I could tell he was about to come out with this ‘are you serious’ line again, so I didn’t let him.
“Yes, I’m serious. Take them off. I want you to use these when you jerk off.”
I knelt up. He moved towards me. He slid his hands up the outside of my thighs, under my short nightdress, and up to my black panties. Yes, the ones I’d caught him playing with before.
Feeling his hands on me was mesmerizing. It was tempting to just have sex. But I was determined to watch him play with himself in my panties.
He peeled my panties off me. Instinctively he moved them straight to his face. I totally got off on watching him sniff my panties. I’d never even thought about anything like this and now it was driving my imagination wild.
Then he took my panties and, while looking into my eyes, wrapped them around his oh-so-delicious looking cock.
Instantly he let out a quiet moan as he touched himself for the first time.
I felt so wet that I was sure I was dripping.
I watched him rub himself slowly with my panties. I wasn’t even sure why this was such a turn on. But it was.
I sat on my bed, back to the wall, and parted my legs. I began to play with myself as he sat on the side of my bed rubbing himself harder and faster.
When he turned and saw me, his eyes widened.
“Fuuuucck,” I heard him whisper.
I could tell he was about to come soon.
I was desperate to see him come all over my panties. I don’t even know why. But I wanted it so badly. Needed it.
And then he did.
His body convulsed in front of me. And I watched as he came, covering my panties. I felt myself getting close to my own orgasm now too.
Another thought flashed into my mind.
“Lick my panties,” I told him. “I want to watch you lick your own cum out of my panties.”
James was so turned on he would have done anything.
And he did.
I watched him lick my panties, feeling more aroused than ever in my life.
“Now come and lick me.”
He didn’t hesitate. He lay between my legs, and moved his mouth to my pussy. I grabbed his head, pulling him tight towards me.
It didn’t take long. I was ready. Barely a minute after his tongue moved around my clit, I was ready to explode.
I squirted all over his face.
I’d never squirted before.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.

I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.
Follow MyErotica for refined erotic fiction to ignite your deepest desires.Shallow breaths
As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
HeThe first time, I was pretty sure I was seeing things. I was in my towel, fresh out the shower, ready to pick my undies before heading out for my uni class in town. Deciding what to wear, I had this vague, mostly subconscious sense that my bras and panties weren’t quite laid out how they were the previous morning.
The second time, I was convinced someone had been in my panty drawer. Some of my panties and thongs we definitely not arranged how I’d left them.
I felt pissed. Which of my housemates was going through my personal stuff? There were five of us living together. Two girls, three guys. None of them seemed the sort who’d go through my lingerie. Then again: how would I know?
The third time I caught him. Sat on my bed, with my favorite black lace panties wrapped around his cock. He was pumping himself hard and fast.
“What the fuck, James?” I said angrily, turning on the light.
“Shit,” was all he managed. And then again: “Shit.”
I’ve never seen anyone look so panicked. Deer in the headlights didn’t come close to it.
He took my panties off his cock, left them on my bed, and zipped himself back up. Then, unable to look me in the eyes, he walked straight past me, head down, and up to his top floor bedroom.
Two hours later I was lying in bed, unable to sleep.
The anger had subsided. Bizarrely, the initial feelings of violation had now turned to intrigue.
I’d never thought of any of my housemates as anything but friends. And now suddenly I couldn’t help but think about James differently.
He was into me.
My thoughts lingered for a moment on seeing his cock.
Out of nowhere, I felt a slight shudder of pleasure go through me thinking about my sexiest panties wrapped around it. Without even realizing, my hand had slipped down between my legs.
What was I thinking? I was shocked at myself. I wanted to feel angry again. That was the normal response I should be having. Right? But I couldn’t get the anger back. Suddenly the whole thing felt thrilling.
Before I could stop myself, I picked up my phone. And I texted him.
“Next time, just ask, okay?”
My heart was racing. What was I doing? I felt instant regret.
Then I heard my phone beep.
“Next time?”
Out of nowhere I felt this longing to see his cock again. With my panties wrapped around it. I wanted to watch him do it.
“How about now?” I wrote impulsively.
“?” he replied instantly.
Did I really want to do this? What was I getting myself into?
Fuck it, I thought.
“Come down and play with my panties again…while I watch,” I texted.
My left hand was rubbing my clit through my panties as I typed on the phone with my right. I hadn’t felt turned on like this in ages. Maybe never quite like this.
My phone beeped again.
“Are you serious?”
I found myself getting almost annoyed at his hesitancy, firing off an instant reply.
“Yes! Now get the fuck down here already.”
I heard the floorboards creak. His room was directly above mine. And then his slow footsteps down the stairs. He knocked gently on my door. Walked in, smiling sheepishly.
He didn’t know what to say.
“I want to watch you jerk off in my panties,” I told him, suddenly feeling bold in a way that surprised me.
I lifted the bedcover off and moved so I was sitting on top of it instead. I indicated for him to come and sit next to me. He was still fully dressed and clearly nervous. I found it quite endearing. And it made me want to take charge like I never had before.
“Take your jeans and boxers off,” I told him.
He could hardly look at me, but did it immediately. I smiled when I saw his cock. So big and hard. Maybe he was nervous, but he was as turned on as I was.
“Now take my panties off for me.”
He looked at me, stunned. I could tell he was about to come out with this ‘are you serious’ line again, so I didn’t let him.
“Yes, I’m serious. Take them off. I want you to use these when you jerk off.”
I knelt up. He moved towards me. He slid his hands up the outside of my thighs, under my short nightdress, and up to my black panties. Yes, the ones I’d caught him playing with before.
Feeling his hands on me was mesmerizing. It was tempting to just have sex. But I was determined to watch him play with himself in my panties.
He peeled my panties off me. Instinctively he moved them straight to his face. I totally got off on watching him sniff my panties. I’d never even thought about anything like this and now it was driving my imagination wild.
Then he took my panties and, while looking into my eyes, wrapped them around his oh-so-delicious looking cock.
Instantly he let out a quiet moan as he touched himself for the first time.
I felt so wet that I was sure I was dripping.
I watched him rub himself slowly with my panties. I wasn’t even sure why this was such a turn on. But it was.
I sat on my bed, back to the wall, and parted my legs. I began to play with myself as he sat on the side of my bed rubbing himself harder and faster.
When he turned and saw me, his eyes widened.
“Fuuuucck,” I heard him whisper.
I could tell he was about to come soon.
I was desperate to see him come all over my panties. I don’t even know why. But I wanted it so badly. Needed it.
And then he did.
His body convulsed in front of me. And I watched as he came, covering my panties. I felt myself getting close to my own orgasm now too.
Another thought flashed into my mind.
“Lick my panties,” I told him. “I want to watch you lick your own cum out of my panties.”
James was so turned on he would have done anything.
And he did.
I watched him lick my panties, feeling more aroused than ever in my life.
“Now come and lick me.”
He didn’t hesitate. He lay between my legs, and moved his mouth to my pussy. I grabbed his head, pulling him tight towards me.
It didn’t take long. I was ready. Barely a minute after his tongue moved around my clit, I was ready to explode.
I squirted all over his face.
I’d never squirted before.I expect my Master soon
and knowing His pleasures, I must
prepare myself for His arrival.
I see myself reflected,
corsetted tight and waist nipped in
black, the way He wants me.
I look to check that
seams are straight and too high heels that
thrust my body into provocation.
I scent the room and
light soft candles, making shadows play upon
the body that will be His to use.
I find His ballgag and
part my lips to take it deep, and tighten the strap
so my cheeks bulge with violation.
I ensure His whip is hanging
where He may reach it when need arouses
and mark me in ways He pleases.
I caress the steel of cuffs
between my fingers, wanting to see them
glittering against yielding skin.
I feel compulsion in His iron bed
that will welcome my spread-eagled body
each shackle open with invitation.
I reach down to encircle ankles
to hear the sound of metal closing
moistening me wide for surrender.
I strain above my head to reach the bars
stretched tight is the way He wants me, I must
tighten steel upon my wrists.
I am here for Him now
knowing not when He will come, only that desire
will grow with the waiting.
I can only stare upwards
knowing that when He comes,
I will be only His.
101 Poems for kinky lovers, by Francesca Anderssen is available in paperback and on the Amazon kindle marketplace.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.

I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.
Follow MyErotica for refined erotic fiction to ignite your deepest desires.Shallow breaths
As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
HeThe first time, I was pretty sure I was seeing things. I was in my towel, fresh out the shower, ready to pick my undies before heading out for my uni class in town. Deciding what to wear, I had this vague, mostly subconscious sense that my bras and panties weren’t quite laid out how they were the previous morning.
The second time, I was convinced someone had been in my panty drawer. Some of my panties and thongs we definitely not arranged how I’d left them.
I felt pissed. Which of my housemates was going through my personal stuff? There were five of us living together. Two girls, three guys. None of them seemed the sort who’d go through my lingerie. Then again: how would I know?
The third time I caught him. Sat on my bed, with my favorite black lace panties wrapped around his cock. He was pumping himself hard and fast.
“What the fuck, James?” I said angrily, turning on the light.
“Shit,” was all he managed. And then again: “Shit.”
I’ve never seen anyone look so panicked. Deer in the headlights didn’t come close to it.
He took my panties off his cock, left them on my bed, and zipped himself back up. Then, unable to look me in the eyes, he walked straight past me, head down, and up to his top floor bedroom.
Two hours later I was lying in bed, unable to sleep.
The anger had subsided. Bizarrely, the initial feelings of violation had now turned to intrigue.
I’d never thought of any of my housemates as anything but friends. And now suddenly I couldn’t help but think about James differently.
He was into me.
My thoughts lingered for a moment on seeing his cock.
Out of nowhere, I felt a slight shudder of pleasure go through me thinking about my sexiest panties wrapped around it. Without even realizing, my hand had slipped down between my legs.
What was I thinking? I was shocked at myself. I wanted to feel angry again. That was the normal response I should be having. Right? But I couldn’t get the anger back. Suddenly the whole thing felt thrilling.
Before I could stop myself, I picked up my phone. And I texted him.
“Next time, just ask, okay?”
My heart was racing. What was I doing? I felt instant regret.
Then I heard my phone beep.
“Next time?”
Out of nowhere I felt this longing to see his cock again. With my panties wrapped around it. I wanted to watch him do it.
“How about now?” I wrote impulsively.
“?” he replied instantly.
Did I really want to do this? What was I getting myself into?
Fuck it, I thought.
“Come down and play with my panties again…while I watch,” I texted.
My left hand was rubbing my clit through my panties as I typed on the phone with my right. I hadn’t felt turned on like this in ages. Maybe never quite like this.
My phone beeped again.
“Are you serious?”
I found myself getting almost annoyed at his hesitancy, firing off an instant reply.
“Yes! Now get the fuck down here already.”
I heard the floorboards creak. His room was directly above mine. And then his slow footsteps down the stairs. He knocked gently on my door. Walked in, smiling sheepishly.
He didn’t know what to say.
“I want to watch you jerk off in my panties,” I told him, suddenly feeling bold in a way that surprised me.
I lifted the bedcover off and moved so I was sitting on top of it instead. I indicated for him to come and sit next to me. He was still fully dressed and clearly nervous. I found it quite endearing. And it made me want to take charge like I never had before.
“Take your jeans and boxers off,” I told him.
He could hardly look at me, but did it immediately. I smiled when I saw his cock. So big and hard. Maybe he was nervous, but he was as turned on as I was.
“Now take my panties off for me.”
He looked at me, stunned. I could tell he was about to come out with this ‘are you serious’ line again, so I didn’t let him.
“Yes, I’m serious. Take them off. I want you to use these when you jerk off.”
I knelt up. He moved towards me. He slid his hands up the outside of my thighs, under my short nightdress, and up to my black panties. Yes, the ones I’d caught him playing with before.
Feeling his hands on me was mesmerizing. It was tempting to just have sex. But I was determined to watch him play with himself in my panties.
He peeled my panties off me. Instinctively he moved them straight to his face. I totally got off on watching him sniff my panties. I’d never even thought about anything like this and now it was driving my imagination wild.
Then he took my panties and, while looking into my eyes, wrapped them around his oh-so-delicious looking cock.
Instantly he let out a quiet moan as he touched himself for the first time.
I felt so wet that I was sure I was dripping.
I watched him rub himself slowly with my panties. I wasn’t even sure why this was such a turn on. But it was.
I sat on my bed, back to the wall, and parted my legs. I began to play with myself as he sat on the side of my bed rubbing himself harder and faster.
When he turned and saw me, his eyes widened.
“Fuuuucck,” I heard him whisper.
I could tell he was about to come soon.
I was desperate to see him come all over my panties. I don’t even know why. But I wanted it so badly. Needed it.
And then he did.
His body convulsed in front of me. And I watched as he came, covering my panties. I felt myself getting close to my own orgasm now too.
Another thought flashed into my mind.
“Lick my panties,” I told him. “I want to watch you lick your own cum out of my panties.”
James was so turned on he would have done anything.
And he did.
I watched him lick my panties, feeling more aroused than ever in my life.
“Now come and lick me.”
He didn’t hesitate. He lay between my legs, and moved his mouth to my pussy. I grabbed his head, pulling him tight towards me.
It didn’t take long. I was ready. Barely a minute after his tongue moved around my clit, I was ready to explode.
I squirted all over his face.
I’d never squirted before.I expect my Master soon
and knowing His pleasures, I must
prepare myself for His arrival.
I see myself reflected,
corsetted tight and waist nipped in
black, the way He wants me.
I look to check that
seams are straight and too high heels that
thrust my body into provocation.
I scent the room and
light soft candles, making shadows play upon
the body that will be His to use.
I find His ballgag and
part my lips to take it deep, and tighten the strap
so my cheeks bulge with violation.
I ensure His whip is hanging
where He may reach it when need arouses
and mark me in ways He pleases.
I caress the steel of cuffs
between my fingers, wanting to see them
glittering against yielding skin.
I feel compulsion in His iron bed
that will welcome my spread-eagled body
each shackle open with invitation.
I reach down to encircle ankles
to hear the sound of metal closing
moistening me wide for surrender.
I strain above my head to reach the bars
stretched tight is the way He wants me, I must
tighten steel upon my wrists.
I am here for Him now
knowing not when He will come, only that desire
will grow with the waiting.
I can only stare upwards
knowing that when He comes,
I will be only His.
101 Poems for kinky lovers, by Francesca Anderssen is available in paperback and on the Amazon kindle marketplace.Take me as your very own
tie me as your love demands
use me now and use me fully
force me down to your commands
I need to know your chains upon me
such craving there will always be
to want your ropes to hurt my body
so your bonds will set me free
Submission is my total needing
wanting you to make it so
taking me to places strangely
where I cannot help but go
You’re the one who now must hold me
I’ve sold myself to your control
with my freedom gone forever
now that you possess my soul
So tie me tighter yet and tighter
my screams must bite the gag you give
use my mind to make me suffer
this is how I want to live.
101 Poems for kinky lovers, by Francesca Anderssen is available in paperback and on the Amazon kindle marketplace.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.
Find more refined stories of lust at MyErotica.com.My Master had taken me out to a pretentious event earlier that evening. Now, back at his place, we could finally be ourselves. His dungeon was my palace and I was his princess.
I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.

As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
HeThe first time, I was pretty sure I was seeing things. I was in my towel, fresh out the shower, ready to pick my undies before heading out for my uni class in town. Deciding what to wear, I had this vague, mostly subconscious sense that my bras and panties weren’t quite laid out how they were the previous morning.
The second time, I was convinced someone had been in my panty drawer. Some of my panties and thongs we definitely not arranged how I’d left them.
I felt pissed. Which of my housemates was going through my personal stuff? There were five of us living together. Two girls, three guys. None of them seemed the sort who’d go through my lingerie. Then again: how would I know?
The third time I caught him. Sat on my bed, with my favorite black lace panties wrapped around his cock. He was pumping himself hard and fast.
“What the fuck, James?” I said angrily, turning on the light.
“Shit,” was all he managed. And then again: “Shit.”
I’ve never seen anyone look so panicked. Deer in the headlights didn’t come close to it.
He took my panties off his cock, left them on my bed, and zipped himself back up. Then, unable to look me in the eyes, he walked straight past me, head down, and up to his top floor bedroom.
Two hours later I was lying in bed, unable to sleep.
The anger had subsided. Bizarrely, the initial feelings of violation had now turned to intrigue.
I’d never thought of any of my housemates as anything but friends. And now suddenly I couldn’t help but think about James differently.
He was into me.
My thoughts lingered for a moment on seeing his cock.
Out of nowhere, I felt a slight shudder of pleasure go through me thinking about my sexiest panties wrapped around it. Without even realizing, my hand had slipped down between my legs.
What was I thinking? I was shocked at myself. I wanted to feel angry again. That was the normal response I should be having. Right? But I couldn’t get the anger back. Suddenly the whole thing felt thrilling.
Before I could stop myself, I picked up my phone. And I texted him.
“Next time, just ask, okay?”
My heart was racing. What was I doing? I felt instant regret.
Then I heard my phone beep.
“Next time?”
Out of nowhere I felt this longing to see his cock again. With my panties wrapped around it. I wanted to watch him do it.
“How about now?” I wrote impulsively.
“?” he replied instantly.
Did I really want to do this? What was I getting myself into?
Fuck it, I thought.
“Come down and play with my panties again…while I watch,” I texted.
My left hand was rubbing my clit through my panties as I typed on the phone with my right. I hadn’t felt turned on like this in ages. Maybe never quite like this.
My phone beeped again.
“Are you serious?”
I found myself getting almost annoyed at his hesitancy, firing off an instant reply.
“Yes! Now get the fuck down here already.”
I heard the floorboards creak. His room was directly above mine. And then his slow footsteps down the stairs. He knocked gently on my door. Walked in, smiling sheepishly.
He didn’t know what to say.
“I want to watch you jerk off in my panties,” I told him, suddenly feeling bold in a way that surprised me.
I lifted the bedcover off and moved so I was sitting on top of it instead. I indicated for him to come and sit next to me. He was still fully dressed and clearly nervous. I found it quite endearing. And it made me want to take charge like I never had before.
“Take your jeans and boxers off,” I told him.
He could hardly look at me, but did it immediately. I smiled when I saw his cock. So big and hard. Maybe he was nervous, but he was as turned on as I was.
“Now take my panties off for me.”
He looked at me, stunned. I could tell he was about to come out with this ‘are you serious’ line again, so I didn’t let him.
“Yes, I’m serious. Take them off. I want you to use these when you jerk off.”
I knelt up. He moved towards me. He slid his hands up the outside of my thighs, under my short nightdress, and up to my black panties. Yes, the ones I’d caught him playing with before.
Feeling his hands on me was mesmerizing. It was tempting to just have sex. But I was determined to watch him play with himself in my panties.
He peeled my panties off me. Instinctively he moved them straight to his face. I totally got off on watching him sniff my panties. I’d never even thought about anything like this and now it was driving my imagination wild.
Then he took my panties and, while looking into my eyes, wrapped them around his oh-so-delicious looking cock.
Instantly he let out a quiet moan as he touched himself for the first time.
I felt so wet that I was sure I was dripping.
I watched him rub himself slowly with my panties. I wasn’t even sure why this was such a turn on. But it was.
I sat on my bed, back to the wall, and parted my legs. I began to play with myself as he sat on the side of my bed rubbing himself harder and faster.
When he turned and saw me, his eyes widened.
“Fuuuucck,” I heard him whisper.
I could tell he was about to come soon.
I was desperate to see him come all over my panties. I don’t even know why. But I wanted it so badly. Needed it.
And then he did.
His body convulsed in front of me. And I watched as he came, covering my panties. I felt myself getting close to my own orgasm now too.
Another thought flashed into my mind.
“Lick my panties,” I told him. “I want to watch you lick your own cum out of my panties.”
James was so turned on he would have done anything.
And he did.
I watched him lick my panties, feeling more aroused than ever in my life.
“Now come and lick me.”
He didn’t hesitate. He lay between my legs, and moved his mouth to my pussy. I grabbed his head, pulling him tight towards me.
It didn’t take long. I was ready. Barely a minute after his tongue moved around my clit, I was ready to explode.
I squirted all over his face.
I’d never squirted before.I expect my Master soon
and knowing His pleasures, I must
prepare myself for His arrival.
I see myself reflected,
corsetted tight and waist nipped in
black, the way He wants me.
I look to check that
seams are straight and too high heels that
thrust my body into provocation.
I scent the room and
light soft candles, making shadows play upon
the body that will be His to use.
I find His ballgag and
part my lips to take it deep, and tighten the strap
so my cheeks bulge with violation.
I ensure His whip is hanging
where He may reach it when need arouses
and mark me in ways He pleases.
I caress the steel of cuffs
between my fingers, wanting to see them
glittering against yielding skin.
I feel compulsion in His iron bed
that will welcome my spread-eagled body
each shackle open with invitation.
I reach down to encircle ankles
to hear the sound of metal closing
moistening me wide for surrender.
I strain above my head to reach the bars
stretched tight is the way He wants me, I must
tighten steel upon my wrists.
I am here for Him now
knowing not when He will come, only that desire
will grow with the waiting.
I can only stare upwards
knowing that when He comes,
I will be only His.
101 Poems for kinky lovers, by Francesca Anderssen is available in paperback and on the Amazon kindle marketplace.Take me as your very own
tie me as your love demands
use me now and use me fully
force me down to your commands
I need to know your chains upon me
such craving there will always be
to want your ropes to hurt my body
so your bonds will set me free
Submission is my total needing
wanting you to make it so
taking me to places strangely
where I cannot help but go
You’re the one who now must hold me
I’ve sold myself to your control
with my freedom gone forever
now that you possess my soul
So tie me tighter yet and tighter
my screams must bite the gag you give
use my mind to make me suffer
this is how I want to live.

Mimi Bordeaux
Nov 7, 2016
Audrey is sitting in a cocktail lounge. She’s sipping her Cosmo, thinking to herself, ‘I deserve a night out. I work hard. It will be nice to enjoy a few drinks.’ She’s happy with her attire and looks elegant. She’s wearing a little black dress with a strand of pearls and her hair is tied up in a French roll.
A plain looking girl enters the bar. She never goes to bars but tonight she’s decided to be adventurous as it’s a warm summer evening. As she walks in she looks around nervously for an empty table. She is thinking, ‘I want to have an encounter… with anyone.’ She has never been in a proper relationship and at 26 she thinks it’s time.
She’s ordering her drink at the bar — a Shirley Temple — when she notices the elegant woman sitting there. Audrey is lost in her own thoughts, but her interest is piqued by Jane’s request for the non-alcoholic drink. She swings her bar stool around to look at her.
Jane summons up the courage to blurt out, “Oh hello… do you come here often?” She feels like a fool for her clichéd opening gambit, but she continues anyway. “I don’t usually go to bars, but here I am.”
Audrey coolly replies, “I like to go out alone and have a few drinks by myself.” She looks Jane up and down, notices that she’s actually rather sweet looking despite her plain clothes, senses her air of barely contained excitement. Her tone becomes warmer. “It’s quite dull here actually. How about you come back to my place and tell me all about yourself?”
“There’s not much to tell,” Jane says nervously, but before she really knows what’s happening she’s agreed to go back to Audrey’s place anyway.
It’s not far by taxi to Audrey’s luxurious apartment. ‘Oh, this is exciting!’ Jane thinks to herself. She still lives with her mother in an ordinary suburban house. Audrey offers her a drink and tells her to make herself comfortable, while she gets changed. She disappears through the double doors leading to her bedroom. Jane looks around; she’s never seen such opulence and she thinks Audrey must be very worldly.
Audrey returns. She has been busy putting on her outfit. She stands there, imposing, looking even taller in fishnet stockings and thigh high leather boots with spike heels. Her black corset barely contains her voluptuous breasts. She is wearing a dog collar around her neck and a black leather mask. She holds a black whip which she flicks every second.
She stares at Jane and says, “Go through that door,” gesturing towards a red leather door off the bedroom with the whip. Jane’s heart is racing. She’s apprehensive but excited by Audrey’s domineering tone. She does as she’s told and enters the room with Audrey following, flicking the whip at her behind. First softly, then a hard crack that stings Jane’s buttocks.
Jane perches on a stool in the middle of the room, the only place to sit, and glances around at her surroundings. Chains, ropes and leather straps hang from the ceiling and walls. She shivers at the sight.
Audrey slams the door shut and barks, “Did I give you permission to sit down?” Jane is confused. Audrey walks toward her, flicking the whip, and stands over her. “Open your legs.” Jane does as she’s told. “Are you getting wet? You must be excited.” Jane squirms, feeling wetness between the tops of her thighs. She’s never felt this way before. There’s a tingling sensation she can’t fathom. It’s because of Audrey.
Jane looks up. Audrey is staring at her and in a second has Jane’s head in her hands. She swipes her tongue up Jane’s cheek then to her mouth, biting hard on the lower lip. She rolls her tongue around Jane’s lips and forcefully enters her mouth, her tongue pushing in deep, grabbing onto Jane’s tongue with her teeth.
Audrey kneels, pulls Jane’s skirt and panties off and moves her head between Jane’s legs. Jane is quivering and needs to hold onto something but there’s nothing except Audrey. She puts her hands on Audrey’s head, winds her fingers into the elegantly coiffured hair. Audrey licks all the way from Jane’s asshole to her clit. She sticks her tongue in Jane’s cunt. In out, in out. She does it over and over again, licking Jane’s whole crack and tongue-fucking her deeper and deeper. Then she focuses on Jane’s clit, licking more softly.
Jane is overwhelmed by the attention and instinctively opens her legs wider. Audrey sucks and nibbles on her swollen clit, licking voraciously. Jane’s head is swimming, she thinks she may faint and her legs are trembling uncontrollably. There’s a fluttering in her stomach like an eel spinning around. She’s sweating, her chest is burning and her face is flushed. She’s on the verge of something, a sensation she’s never felt before. It’s building up from her toes, up her legs; between them she feels a gush of fluid. Suddenly she throws her head back, straining, her eyes tight shut; she grabs Audrey’s head and makes a high-pitched involuntary screech. She can’t think, see or hear any more, but she’s screaming out her pleasure as she slides off the stool.
“Shut up!” Audrey says harshly, pulling her to her feet and leading her by the neck to some ropes hanging from the ceiling. She ties Jane’s hands tightly and tells her to bend over. Jane is giddy, but she does as she’s told. There’s a sound behind her, then she feels something touching her cunt. It thrusts inside her, going right to the hilt, then out again. It goes in again and starts to move slowly, in out, in out. Jane moans as the thrusting becomes more intense.
Now it’s moving more quickly, sending waves of heat up Jane’s body. She moans and whispers, “Yes… oh yes!” as Audrey pumps her cunt with force. Audrey slams the dildo in, pressing at a special spot that has Jane intoxicated. Jane can’t hold back any longer and yells out, clutching at the rope, sweat dripping from her forehead, her cunt soaking wet and squirting juices that dribble down her thighs.
Audrey turns Jane around and thrusts the dildo into her mouth, making her gag for a moment before she adjusts to its size. “Suck!” says Audrey sternly. The dildo is coated with cum and Jane tastes her own juice for the first time.
Audrey unties Jane’s wrists and buckles a dog collar around her neck, with a short leash attached. She leads her to a wooden table. “Bend over and put your ass in the air, slut,” she commands her. The words have an instant effect on Jane, who feels her cunt swell and throb, more wetness trickling down her thighs. She’s so turned on.
Audrey holds onto the leash and rubs her finger against Jane’s asshole. Jane feels something cold and sticky being spread over her, and then Audrey’s fingertip wriggling into her ass. It feels strange, but good. The finger goes a little deeper, and then suddenly thrusts all the way inside. She yells.
“Shut up, slut,” Audrey says, adding a second finger and pumping them in and out of Jane’s ass. Jane lies flat against the table, ass up, and takes it. She starts to like it. She moans with each stroke.
“You like that do you, my little slut?” Audrey says, going deeper and faster. Jane is dizzy with excitement, growling and howling. Her orgasm fires through her whole body, radiating out from her core.
After a few minutes Audrey withdraws her fingers and Jane slumps down onto the table, exhausted. Audrey grabs the leash, making Jane stand, then removes the collar. She stares at Jane. She grabs her head and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck, then kisses her on the mouth.
“Time for you to go home,” she says. “You know the way out.” She marches Jane to the red door and pushes her through it, throwing her clothes after her. Jane dresses rapidly and staggers to the front door. Her pussy and ass are throbbing as she runs down the stairs. She’s floating. She feels like a bird in flight. She begins to walk.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.
Find more refined stories of lust at MyErotica.com.My Master had taken me out to a pretentious event earlier that evening. Now, back at his place, we could finally be ourselves. His dungeon was my palace and I was his princess.
I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.
Follow MyErotica for refined erotic fiction to ignite your deepest desires.Shallow breaths
As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
HeThe first time, I was pretty sure I was seeing things. I was in my towel, fresh out the shower, ready to pick my undies before heading out for my uni class in town. Deciding what to wear, I had this vague, mostly subconscious sense that my bras and panties weren’t quite laid out how they were the previous morning.
The second time, I was convinced someone had been in my panty drawer. Some of my panties and thongs we definitely not arranged how I’d left them.
I felt pissed. Which of my housemates was going through my personal stuff? There were five of us living together. Two girls, three guys. None of them seemed the sort who’d go through my lingerie. Then again: how would I know?
The third time I caught him. Sat on my bed, with my favorite black lace panties wrapped around his cock. He was pumping himself hard and fast.
“What the fuck, James?” I said angrily, turning on the light.
“Shit,” was all he managed. And then again: “Shit.”
I’ve never seen anyone look so panicked. Deer in the headlights didn’t come close to it.
He took my panties off his cock, left them on my bed, and zipped himself back up. Then, unable to look me in the eyes, he walked straight past me, head down, and up to his top floor bedroom.
Two hours later I was lying in bed, unable to sleep.
The anger had subsided. Bizarrely, the initial feelings of violation had now turned to intrigue.
I’d never thought of any of my housemates as anything but friends. And now suddenly I couldn’t help but think about James differently.
He was into me.
My thoughts lingered for a moment on seeing his cock.
Out of nowhere, I felt a slight shudder of pleasure go through me thinking about my sexiest panties wrapped around it. Without even realizing, my hand had slipped down between my legs.
What was I thinking? I was shocked at myself. I wanted to feel angry again. That was the normal response I should be having. Right? But I couldn’t get the anger back. Suddenly the whole thing felt thrilling.
Before I could stop myself, I picked up my phone. And I texted him.
“Next time, just ask, okay?”
My heart was racing. What was I doing? I felt instant regret.
Then I heard my phone beep.
“Next time?”
Out of nowhere I felt this longing to see his cock again. With my panties wrapped around it. I wanted to watch him do it.
“How about now?” I wrote impulsively.
“?” he replied instantly.
Did I really want to do this? What was I getting myself into?
Fuck it, I thought.
“Come down and play with my panties again…while I watch,” I texted.
My left hand was rubbing my clit through my panties as I typed on the phone with my right. I hadn’t felt turned on like this in ages. Maybe never quite like this.
My phone beeped again.
“Are you serious?”
I found myself getting almost annoyed at his hesitancy, firing off an instant reply.
“Yes! Now get the fuck down here already.”
I heard the floorboards creak. His room was directly above mine. And then his slow footsteps down the stairs. He knocked gently on my door. Walked in, smiling sheepishly.
He didn’t know what to say.
“I want to watch you jerk off in my panties,” I told him, suddenly feeling bold in a way that surprised me.
I lifted the bedcover off and moved so I was sitting on top of it instead. I indicated for him to come and sit next to me. He was still fully dressed and clearly nervous. I found it quite endearing. And it made me want to take charge like I never had before.
“Take your jeans and boxers off,” I told him.
He could hardly look at me, but did it immediately. I smiled when I saw his cock. So big and hard. Maybe he was nervous, but he was as turned on as I was.
“Now take my panties off for me.”
He looked at me, stunned. I could tell he was about to come out with this ‘are you serious’ line again, so I didn’t let him.
“Yes, I’m serious. Take them off. I want you to use these when you jerk off.”
I knelt up. He moved towards me. He slid his hands up the outside of my thighs, under my short nightdress, and up to my black panties. Yes, the ones I’d caught him playing with before.
Feeling his hands on me was mesmerizing. It was tempting to just have sex. But I was determined to watch him play with himself in my panties.
He peeled my panties off me. Instinctively he moved them straight to his face. I totally got off on watching him sniff my panties. I’d never even thought about anything like this and now it was driving my imagination wild.
Then he took my panties and, while looking into my eyes, wrapped them around his oh-so-delicious looking cock.
Instantly he let out a quiet moan as he touched himself for the first time.
I felt so wet that I was sure I was dripping.
I watched him rub himself slowly with my panties. I wasn’t even sure why this was such a turn on. But it was.
I sat on my bed, back to the wall, and parted my legs. I began to play with myself as he sat on the side of my bed rubbing himself harder and faster.
When he turned and saw me, his eyes widened.
“Fuuuucck,” I heard him whisper.
I could tell he was about to come soon.
I was desperate to see him come all over my panties. I don’t even know why. But I wanted it so badly. Needed it.
And then he did.
His body convulsed in front of me. And I watched as he came, covering my panties. I felt myself getting close to my own orgasm now too.
Another thought flashed into my mind.
“Lick my panties,” I told him. “I want to watch you lick your own cum out of my panties.”
James was so turned on he would have done anything.
And he did.
I watched him lick my panties, feeling more aroused than ever in my life.
“Now come and lick me.”
He didn’t hesitate. He lay between my legs, and moved his mouth to my pussy. I grabbed his head, pulling him tight towards me.
It didn’t take long. I was ready. Barely a minute after his tongue moved around my clit, I was ready to explode.
I squirted all over his face.
I’d never squirted before.I expect my Master soon
and knowing His pleasures, I must
prepare myself for His arrival.
I see myself reflected,
corsetted tight and waist nipped in
black, the way He wants me.
I look to check that
seams are straight and too high heels that
thrust my body into provocation.
I scent the room and
light soft candles, making shadows play upon
the body that will be His to use.
I find His ballgag and
part my lips to take it deep, and tighten the strap
so my cheeks bulge with violation.
I ensure His whip is hanging
where He may reach it when need arouses
and mark me in ways He pleases.
I caress the steel of cuffs
between my fingers, wanting to see them
glittering against yielding skin.
I feel compulsion in His iron bed
that will welcome my spread-eagled body
each shackle open with invitation.
I reach down to encircle ankles
to hear the sound of metal closing
moistening me wide for surrender.
I strain above my head to reach the bars
stretched tight is the way He wants me, I must
tighten steel upon my wrists.
I am here for Him now
knowing not when He will come, only that desire
will grow with the waiting.
I can only stare upwards
knowing that when He comes,
I will be only His.
101 Poems for kinky lovers, by Francesca Anderssen is available in paperback and on the Amazon kindle marketplace.Take me as your very own
tie me as your love demands
use me now and use me fully
force me down to your commands
I need to know your chains upon me
such craving there will always be
to want your ropes to hurt my body
so your bonds will set me free
Submission is my total needing
wanting you to make it so
taking me to places strangely
where I cannot help but go
You’re the one who now must hold me
I’ve sold myself to your control
with my freedom gone forever
now that you possess my soul
So tie me tighter yet and tighter
my screams must bite the gag you give
use my mind to make me suffer
this is how I want to live.

Mimi Bordeaux
Nov 7, 2016
Audrey is sitting in a cocktail lounge. She’s sipping her Cosmo, thinking to herself, ‘I deserve a night out. I work hard. It will be nice to enjoy a few drinks.’ She’s happy with her attire and looks elegant. She’s wearing a little black dress with a strand of pearls and her hair is tied up in a French roll.
A plain looking girl enters the bar. She never goes to bars but tonight she’s decided to be adventurous as it’s a warm summer evening. As she walks in she looks around nervously for an empty table. She is thinking, ‘I want to have an encounter… with anyone.’ She has never been in a proper relationship and at 26 she thinks it’s time.
She’s ordering her drink at the bar — a Shirley Temple — when she notices the elegant woman sitting there. Audrey is lost in her own thoughts, but her interest is piqued by Jane’s request for the non-alcoholic drink. She swings her bar stool around to look at her.
Jane summons up the courage to blurt out, “Oh hello… do you come here often?” She feels like a fool for her clichéd opening gambit, but she continues anyway. “I don’t usually go to bars, but here I am.”
Audrey coolly replies, “I like to go out alone and have a few drinks by myself.” She looks Jane up and down, notices that she’s actually rather sweet looking despite her plain clothes, senses her air of barely contained excitement. Her tone becomes warmer. “It’s quite dull here actually. How about you come back to my place and tell me all about yourself?”
“There’s not much to tell,” Jane says nervously, but before she really knows what’s happening she’s agreed to go back to Audrey’s place anyway.
It’s not far by taxi to Audrey’s luxurious apartment. ‘Oh, this is exciting!’ Jane thinks to herself. She still lives with her mother in an ordinary suburban house. Audrey offers her a drink and tells her to make herself comfortable, while she gets changed. She disappears through the double doors leading to her bedroom. Jane looks around; she’s never seen such opulence and she thinks Audrey must be very worldly.
Audrey returns. She has been busy putting on her outfit. She stands there, imposing, looking even taller in fishnet stockings and thigh high leather boots with spike heels. Her black corset barely contains her voluptuous breasts. She is wearing a dog collar around her neck and a black leather mask. She holds a black whip which she flicks every second.
She stares at Jane and says, “Go through that door,” gesturing towards a red leather door off the bedroom with the whip. Jane’s heart is racing. She’s apprehensive but excited by Audrey’s domineering tone. She does as she’s told and enters the room with Audrey following, flicking the whip at her behind. First softly, then a hard crack that stings Jane’s buttocks.
Jane perches on a stool in the middle of the room, the only place to sit, and glances around at her surroundings. Chains, ropes and leather straps hang from the ceiling and walls. She shivers at the sight.
Audrey slams the door shut and barks, “Did I give you permission to sit down?” Jane is confused. Audrey walks toward her, flicking the whip, and stands over her. “Open your legs.” Jane does as she’s told. “Are you getting wet? You must be excited.” Jane squirms, feeling wetness between the tops of her thighs. She’s never felt this way before. There’s a tingling sensation she can’t fathom. It’s because of Audrey.
Jane looks up. Audrey is staring at her and in a second has Jane’s head in her hands. She swipes her tongue up Jane’s cheek then to her mouth, biting hard on the lower lip. She rolls her tongue around Jane’s lips and forcefully enters her mouth, her tongue pushing in deep, grabbing onto Jane’s tongue with her teeth.
Audrey kneels, pulls Jane’s skirt and panties off and moves her head between Jane’s legs. Jane is quivering and needs to hold onto something but there’s nothing except Audrey. She puts her hands on Audrey’s head, winds her fingers into the elegantly coiffured hair. Audrey licks all the way from Jane’s asshole to her clit. She sticks her tongue in Jane’s cunt. In out, in out. She does it over and over again, licking Jane’s whole crack and tongue-fucking her deeper and deeper. Then she focuses on Jane’s clit, licking more softly.
Jane is overwhelmed by the attention and instinctively opens her legs wider. Audrey sucks and nibbles on her swollen clit, licking voraciously. Jane’s head is swimming, she thinks she may faint and her legs are trembling uncontrollably. There’s a fluttering in her stomach like an eel spinning around. She’s sweating, her chest is burning and her face is flushed. She’s on the verge of something, a sensation she’s never felt before. It’s building up from her toes, up her legs; between them she feels a gush of fluid. Suddenly she throws her head back, straining, her eyes tight shut; she grabs Audrey’s head and makes a high-pitched involuntary screech. She can’t think, see or hear any more, but she’s screaming out her pleasure as she slides off the stool.
“Shut up!” Audrey says harshly, pulling her to her feet and leading her by the neck to some ropes hanging from the ceiling. She ties Jane’s hands tightly and tells her to bend over. Jane is giddy, but she does as she’s told. There’s a sound behind her, then she feels something touching her cunt. It thrusts inside her, going right to the hilt, then out again. It goes in again and starts to move slowly, in out, in out. Jane moans as the thrusting becomes more intense.
Now it’s moving more quickly, sending waves of heat up Jane’s body. She moans and whispers, “Yes… oh yes!” as Audrey pumps her cunt with force. Audrey slams the dildo in, pressing at a special spot that has Jane intoxicated. Jane can’t hold back any longer and yells out, clutching at the rope, sweat dripping from her forehead, her cunt soaking wet and squirting juices that dribble down her thighs.
Audrey turns Jane around and thrusts the dildo into her mouth, making her gag for a moment before she adjusts to its size. “Suck!” says Audrey sternly. The dildo is coated with cum and Jane tastes her own juice for the first time.
Audrey unties Jane’s wrists and buckles a dog collar around her neck, with a short leash attached. She leads her to a wooden table. “Bend over and put your ass in the air, slut,” she commands her. The words have an instant effect on Jane, who feels her cunt swell and throb, more wetness trickling down her thighs. She’s so turned on.
Audrey holds onto the leash and rubs her finger against Jane’s asshole. Jane feels something cold and sticky being spread over her, and then Audrey’s fingertip wriggling into her ass. It feels strange, but good. The finger goes a little deeper, and then suddenly thrusts all the way inside. She yells.
“Shut up, slut,” Audrey says, adding a second finger and pumping them in and out of Jane’s ass. Jane lies flat against the table, ass up, and takes it. She starts to like it. She moans with each stroke.
“You like that do you, my little slut?” Audrey says, going deeper and faster. Jane is dizzy with excitement, growling and howling. Her orgasm fires through her whole body, radiating out from her core.
After a few minutes Audrey withdraws her fingers and Jane slumps down onto the table, exhausted. Audrey grabs the leash, making Jane stand, then removes the collar. She stares at Jane. She grabs her head and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck, then kisses her on the mouth.
“Time for you to go home,” she says. “You know the way out.” She marches Jane to the red door and pushes her through it, throwing her clothes after her. Jane dresses rapidly and staggers to the front door. Her pussy and ass are throbbing as she runs down the stairs. She’s floating. She feels like a bird in flight. She begins to walk.This girl looks exactly like me. The same long, wavy blonde hair. The same blue-grey eyes, the sprinkling of freckles over the bridge of her nose. The same slender fingers, moving to my nipple, as mine move to hers. We could be twins.
Only the tattoo on my back and the one on her foot mark us apart. She laughs when she undresses me and sees mine.
“Maybe I need to get one like it,” she says, getting down on her knees to kiss it, lick it; her tongue moving lower, down the cleft of my ass.
We met earlier that night, in a bar.
Coming face to face, I think for a moment that I’m walking into a mirror. We stare at each other for a long while, fascinated.
Before long we’ve both ditched our dates and are huddled in a corner, insulated from the noise of the bar by our absorption in each other. We’re drunk on the sight of each other, cataloguing the myriad points on which we are the same and the few tiny differences, obsessively.
“You’re just like me,” we keep telling each other.
When she asks my name and I say, ‘Narcisse,’ she laughs delightedly, getting the reference at once: Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection and died for love of himself.
She tells me hers is ‘Belle,’ which I know means beautiful; I’m not sure whether or not she’s lying but I like the inference, so I call her Belle anyway.
A little later and we’re sitting so close she’s practically on my lap, kissing avidly.
“Bet you’d fuck yourself if you could, wouldn’t you?” she says.
“Of course I would. Wouldn’t you?” She nods, unabashed. “Want to find out what it feels like?”
She nods again, runs a fingertip up my thigh as she leans in to whisper, “Your place or mine?”
My place then, the bedroom lights blazing so we can see every minute detail of each other as we undress, touch, explore. Every inch of her body looks strangely familiar. I lick each smooth expanse of skin as I uncover it, mapping the territory as I go, noting each hair and freckle. She shivers with arousal as I kiss her neck and then on downward, cupping a breast and sucking the nipple; she moans and I feel it harden against my tongue. Her responsiveness pleases me and my own nipples stiffen in sympathy, as if what I’m doing to her is physically mirrored in my own trembling flesh. I suck harder, my hands encircling her waist and running down over her hips.
I kiss and lick my way down her taut stomach, feeling it ripple at my light touch, then slide her panties down to her thighs and gaze at her pussy, enthralled. A neat tuft of blonde curls crowns her smooth, plump-lipped cunt. It’s like looking at myself from an angle I’ve never experienced before. I stare and stare until the intensity makes her fidget and she breaks the spell by pulling me onto the bed, breathless and flushed.
“What do you like?” she asks; meaning: how shall I get you off?
“You know what I like,” I reply, meaning: we’re the same. I like what you like.
Turns out I’m both right and wrong. She starts out gentle and teasing, kissing and licking around the edge of my skimpy panties, sucking my inner thigh, then licking me through the thin fabric until I’m dripping. By the time she peels my panties off and skims a fingertip along the slippery groove between my lips, I’m fighting the urge to tell her faster, harder, fuck me now! But it seems the teasing is what I wanted after all. Her touch is insistent, hypnotic, a slow build to a long drawn-out orgasm that has me screaming when she finally lets me come with three fingers plunging into my drenched hole and her lips suctioned around my clit.
I roll her onto her back and straddle her, kissing her insatiably, licking my cream from her lips. Pulling back to look into her eyes, I’m giddy with lust. For one vertiginous moment I feel as if I’m falling into a mirror, fucking myself into insanity.
Now all I can think about is tasting her. I spin around into a sixty-nine so I can hover my pussy over her face, too sensitive from my orgasm for much contact but shivering with arousal as she flicks her tongue delicately over my folds. My approach is more direct, more brutal; she’s shown me how she likes to be touched and now I’m teaching her my way. Spreading her open with my fingers, I swipe my tongue across her clit, over and over, relentless. My elbows pin her knees apart, my weight pinioning her so however much she squirms, she can’t escape the overpowering sensations. When she’s moaning and babbling deliriously, her hips juddering as she tries to hump up against my tongue, I thrust two fingers from each hand inside her, stretching her open and curling them to seek out her G-spot. Her hips buck so hard she nearly throws me off her as she comes, soaking my hands. She tastes just like me and that thought, coupled with the way she sucks fiercely at my cunt as she loses it, makes me come again.
We lie facing each other, and gaze into each other’s eyes, absorbing this information, the new things we’ve learned about ourselves from each other.
“I never knew I could come like that,” she says, wonderingly.
“I never knew I liked to be teased so much,” I laugh. She reaches for me again, kissing me hard as she slides one leg between my thighs, hooking the other over my hip. A little shuffling and we’re grinding together, pussy to pussy, both so hot and wet. There’s just enough friction to drive me out of my mind, my clit throbbing as I rub against her, hips moving in tight circles. This time, coming feels like hurtling down a long, dark tunnel into an explosion of light. I don’t know if the hammering against my chest is her heart or mine. The sense of consummation is profound.
We’ve been kissing and fingering, licking and sucking and fucking each other for so many hours it’s daylight when we finally disengage, blissed out and exhausted.
“Can I see you again,” she asks.
“You’ll see me every time you look in the mirror,” I reply.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.

I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.
Follow MyErotica for refined erotic fiction to ignite your deepest desires.Shallow breaths
As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
HeThe first time, I was pretty sure I was seeing things. I was in my towel, fresh out the shower, ready to pick my undies before heading out for my uni class in town. Deciding what to wear, I had this vague, mostly subconscious sense that my bras and panties weren’t quite laid out how they were the previous morning.
The second time, I was convinced someone had been in my panty drawer. Some of my panties and thongs we definitely not arranged how I’d left them.
I felt pissed. Which of my housemates was going through my personal stuff? There were five of us living together. Two girls, three guys. None of them seemed the sort who’d go through my lingerie. Then again: how would I know?
The third time I caught him. Sat on my bed, with my favorite black lace panties wrapped around his cock. He was pumping himself hard and fast.
“What the fuck, James?” I said angrily, turning on the light.
“Shit,” was all he managed. And then again: “Shit.”
I’ve never seen anyone look so panicked. Deer in the headlights didn’t come close to it.
He took my panties off his cock, left them on my bed, and zipped himself back up. Then, unable to look me in the eyes, he walked straight past me, head down, and up to his top floor bedroom.
Two hours later I was lying in bed, unable to sleep.
The anger had subsided. Bizarrely, the initial feelings of violation had now turned to intrigue.
I’d never thought of any of my housemates as anything but friends. And now suddenly I couldn’t help but think about James differently.
He was into me.
My thoughts lingered for a moment on seeing his cock.
Out of nowhere, I felt a slight shudder of pleasure go through me thinking about my sexiest panties wrapped around it. Without even realizing, my hand had slipped down between my legs.
What was I thinking? I was shocked at myself. I wanted to feel angry again. That was the normal response I should be having. Right? But I couldn’t get the anger back. Suddenly the whole thing felt thrilling.
Before I could stop myself, I picked up my phone. And I texted him.
“Next time, just ask, okay?”
My heart was racing. What was I doing? I felt instant regret.
Then I heard my phone beep.
“Next time?”
Out of nowhere I felt this longing to see his cock again. With my panties wrapped around it. I wanted to watch him do it.
“How about now?” I wrote impulsively.
“?” he replied instantly.
Did I really want to do this? What was I getting myself into?
Fuck it, I thought.
“Come down and play with my panties again…while I watch,” I texted.
My left hand was rubbing my clit through my panties as I typed on the phone with my right. I hadn’t felt turned on like this in ages. Maybe never quite like this.
My phone beeped again.
“Are you serious?”
I found myself getting almost annoyed at his hesitancy, firing off an instant reply.
“Yes! Now get the fuck down here already.”
I heard the floorboards creak. His room was directly above mine. And then his slow footsteps down the stairs. He knocked gently on my door. Walked in, smiling sheepishly.
He didn’t know what to say.
“I want to watch you jerk off in my panties,” I told him, suddenly feeling bold in a way that surprised me.
I lifted the bedcover off and moved so I was sitting on top of it instead. I indicated for him to come and sit next to me. He was still fully dressed and clearly nervous. I found it quite endearing. And it made me want to take charge like I never had before.
“Take your jeans and boxers off,” I told him.
He could hardly look at me, but did it immediately. I smiled when I saw his cock. So big and hard. Maybe he was nervous, but he was as turned on as I was.
“Now take my panties off for me.”
He looked at me, stunned. I could tell he was about to come out with this ‘are you serious’ line again, so I didn’t let him.
“Yes, I’m serious. Take them off. I want you to use these when you jerk off.”
I knelt up. He moved towards me. He slid his hands up the outside of my thighs, under my short nightdress, and up to my black panties. Yes, the ones I’d caught him playing with before.
Feeling his hands on me was mesmerizing. It was tempting to just have sex. But I was determined to watch him play with himself in my panties.
He peeled my panties off me. Instinctively he moved them straight to his face. I totally got off on watching him sniff my panties. I’d never even thought about anything like this and now it was driving my imagination wild.
Then he took my panties and, while looking into my eyes, wrapped them around his oh-so-delicious looking cock.
Instantly he let out a quiet moan as he touched himself for the first time.
I felt so wet that I was sure I was dripping.
I watched him rub himself slowly with my panties. I wasn’t even sure why this was such a turn on. But it was.
I sat on my bed, back to the wall, and parted my legs. I began to play with myself as he sat on the side of my bed rubbing himself harder and faster.
When he turned and saw me, his eyes widened.
“Fuuuucck,” I heard him whisper.
I could tell he was about to come soon.
I was desperate to see him come all over my panties. I don’t even know why. But I wanted it so badly. Needed it.
And then he did.
His body convulsed in front of me. And I watched as he came, covering my panties. I felt myself getting close to my own orgasm now too.
Another thought flashed into my mind.
“Lick my panties,” I told him. “I want to watch you lick your own cum out of my panties.”
James was so turned on he would have done anything.
And he did.
I watched him lick my panties, feeling more aroused than ever in my life.
“Now come and lick me.”
He didn’t hesitate. He lay between my legs, and moved his mouth to my pussy. I grabbed his head, pulling him tight towards me.
It didn’t take long. I was ready. Barely a minute after his tongue moved around my clit, I was ready to explode.
I squirted all over his face.
I’d never squirted before.I expect my Master soon
and knowing His pleasures, I must
prepare myself for His arrival.
I see myself reflected,
corsetted tight and waist nipped in
black, the way He wants me.
I look to check that
seams are straight and too high heels that
thrust my body into provocation.
I scent the room and
light soft candles, making shadows play upon
the body that will be His to use.
I find His ballgag and
part my lips to take it deep, and tighten the strap
so my cheeks bulge with violation.
I ensure His whip is hanging
where He may reach it when need arouses
and mark me in ways He pleases.
I caress the steel of cuffs
between my fingers, wanting to see them
glittering against yielding skin.
I feel compulsion in His iron bed
that will welcome my spread-eagled body
each shackle open with invitation.
I reach down to encircle ankles
to hear the sound of metal closing
moistening me wide for surrender.
I strain above my head to reach the bars
stretched tight is the way He wants me, I must
tighten steel upon my wrists.
I am here for Him now
knowing not when He will come, only that desire
will grow with the waiting.
I can only stare upwards
knowing that when He comes,
I will be only His.
101 Poems for kinky lovers, by Francesca Anderssen is available in paperback and on the Amazon kindle marketplace.Take me as your very own
tie me as your love demands
use me now and use me fully
force me down to your commands
I need to know your chains upon me
such craving there will always be
to want your ropes to hurt my body
so your bonds will set me free
Submission is my total needing
wanting you to make it so
taking me to places strangely
where I cannot help but go
You’re the one who now must hold me
I’ve sold myself to your control
with my freedom gone forever
now that you possess my soul
So tie me tighter yet and tighter
my screams must bite the gag you give
use my mind to make me suffer
this is how I want to live.

Mimi Bordeaux
Nov 7, 2016
Audrey is sitting in a cocktail lounge. She’s sipping her Cosmo, thinking to herself, ‘I deserve a night out. I work hard. It will be nice to enjoy a few drinks.’ She’s happy with her attire and looks elegant. She’s wearing a little black dress with a strand of pearls and her hair is tied up in a French roll.
A plain looking girl enters the bar. She never goes to bars but tonight she’s decided to be adventurous as it’s a warm summer evening. As she walks in she looks around nervously for an empty table. She is thinking, ‘I want to have an encounter… with anyone.’ She has never been in a proper relationship and at 26 she thinks it’s time.
She’s ordering her drink at the bar — a Shirley Temple — when she notices the elegant woman sitting there. Audrey is lost in her own thoughts, but her interest is piqued by Jane’s request for the non-alcoholic drink. She swings her bar stool around to look at her.
Jane summons up the courage to blurt out, “Oh hello… do you come here often?” She feels like a fool for her clichéd opening gambit, but she continues anyway. “I don’t usually go to bars, but here I am.”
Audrey coolly replies, “I like to go out alone and have a few drinks by myself.” She looks Jane up and down, notices that she’s actually rather sweet looking despite her plain clothes, senses her air of barely contained excitement. Her tone becomes warmer. “It’s quite dull here actually. How about you come back to my place and tell me all about yourself?”
“There’s not much to tell,” Jane says nervously, but before she really knows what’s happening she’s agreed to go back to Audrey’s place anyway.
It’s not far by taxi to Audrey’s luxurious apartment. ‘Oh, this is exciting!’ Jane thinks to herself. She still lives with her mother in an ordinary suburban house. Audrey offers her a drink and tells her to make herself comfortable, while she gets changed. She disappears through the double doors leading to her bedroom. Jane looks around; she’s never seen such opulence and she thinks Audrey must be very worldly.
Audrey returns. She has been busy putting on her outfit. She stands there, imposing, looking even taller in fishnet stockings and thigh high leather boots with spike heels. Her black corset barely contains her voluptuous breasts. She is wearing a dog collar around her neck and a black leather mask. She holds a black whip which she flicks every second.
She stares at Jane and says, “Go through that door,” gesturing towards a red leather door off the bedroom with the whip. Jane’s heart is racing. She’s apprehensive but excited by Audrey’s domineering tone. She does as she’s told and enters the room with Audrey following, flicking the whip at her behind. First softly, then a hard crack that stings Jane’s buttocks.
Jane perches on a stool in the middle of the room, the only place to sit, and glances around at her surroundings. Chains, ropes and leather straps hang from the ceiling and walls. She shivers at the sight.
Audrey slams the door shut and barks, “Did I give you permission to sit down?” Jane is confused. Audrey walks toward her, flicking the whip, and stands over her. “Open your legs.” Jane does as she’s told. “Are you getting wet? You must be excited.” Jane squirms, feeling wetness between the tops of her thighs. She’s never felt this way before. There’s a tingling sensation she can’t fathom. It’s because of Audrey.
Jane looks up. Audrey is staring at her and in a second has Jane’s head in her hands. She swipes her tongue up Jane’s cheek then to her mouth, biting hard on the lower lip. She rolls her tongue around Jane’s lips and forcefully enters her mouth, her tongue pushing in deep, grabbing onto Jane’s tongue with her teeth.
Audrey kneels, pulls Jane’s skirt and panties off and moves her head between Jane’s legs. Jane is quivering and needs to hold onto something but there’s nothing except Audrey. She puts her hands on Audrey’s head, winds her fingers into the elegantly coiffured hair. Audrey licks all the way from Jane’s asshole to her clit. She sticks her tongue in Jane’s cunt. In out, in out. She does it over and over again, licking Jane’s whole crack and tongue-fucking her deeper and deeper. Then she focuses on Jane’s clit, licking more softly.
Jane is overwhelmed by the attention and instinctively opens her legs wider. Audrey sucks and nibbles on her swollen clit, licking voraciously. Jane’s head is swimming, she thinks she may faint and her legs are trembling uncontrollably. There’s a fluttering in her stomach like an eel spinning around. She’s sweating, her chest is burning and her face is flushed. She’s on the verge of something, a sensation she’s never felt before. It’s building up from her toes, up her legs; between them she feels a gush of fluid. Suddenly she throws her head back, straining, her eyes tight shut; she grabs Audrey’s head and makes a high-pitched involuntary screech. She can’t think, see or hear any more, but she’s screaming out her pleasure as she slides off the stool.
“Shut up!” Audrey says harshly, pulling her to her feet and leading her by the neck to some ropes hanging from the ceiling. She ties Jane’s hands tightly and tells her to bend over. Jane is giddy, but she does as she’s told. There’s a sound behind her, then she feels something touching her cunt. It thrusts inside her, going right to the hilt, then out again. It goes in again and starts to move slowly, in out, in out. Jane moans as the thrusting becomes more intense.
Now it’s moving more quickly, sending waves of heat up Jane’s body. She moans and whispers, “Yes… oh yes!” as Audrey pumps her cunt with force. Audrey slams the dildo in, pressing at a special spot that has Jane intoxicated. Jane can’t hold back any longer and yells out, clutching at the rope, sweat dripping from her forehead, her cunt soaking wet and squirting juices that dribble down her thighs.
Audrey turns Jane around and thrusts the dildo into her mouth, making her gag for a moment before she adjusts to its size. “Suck!” says Audrey sternly. The dildo is coated with cum and Jane tastes her own juice for the first time.
Audrey unties Jane’s wrists and buckles a dog collar around her neck, with a short leash attached. She leads her to a wooden table. “Bend over and put your ass in the air, slut,” she commands her. The words have an instant effect on Jane, who feels her cunt swell and throb, more wetness trickling down her thighs. She’s so turned on.
Audrey holds onto the leash and rubs her finger against Jane’s asshole. Jane feels something cold and sticky being spread over her, and then Audrey’s fingertip wriggling into her ass. It feels strange, but good. The finger goes a little deeper, and then suddenly thrusts all the way inside. She yells.
“Shut up, slut,” Audrey says, adding a second finger and pumping them in and out of Jane’s ass. Jane lies flat against the table, ass up, and takes it. She starts to like it. She moans with each stroke.
“You like that do you, my little slut?” Audrey says, going deeper and faster. Jane is dizzy with excitement, growling and howling. Her orgasm fires through her whole body, radiating out from her core.
After a few minutes Audrey withdraws her fingers and Jane slumps down onto the table, exhausted. Audrey grabs the leash, making Jane stand, then removes the collar. She stares at Jane. She grabs her head and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck, then kisses her on the mouth.
“Time for you to go home,” she says. “You know the way out.” She marches Jane to the red door and pushes her through it, throwing her clothes after her. Jane dresses rapidly and staggers to the front door. Her pussy and ass are throbbing as she runs down the stairs. She’s floating. She feels like a bird in flight. She begins to walk.This girl looks exactly like me. The same long, wavy blonde hair. The same blue-grey eyes, the sprinkling of freckles over the bridge of her nose. The same slender fingers, moving to my nipple, as mine move to hers. We could be twins.
Only the tattoo on my back and the one on her foot mark us apart. She laughs when she undresses me and sees mine.
“Maybe I need to get one like it,” she says, getting down on her knees to kiss it, lick it; her tongue moving lower, down the cleft of my ass.
We met earlier that night, in a bar.
Coming face to face, I think for a moment that I’m walking into a mirror. We stare at each other for a long while, fascinated.
Before long we’ve both ditched our dates and are huddled in a corner, insulated from the noise of the bar by our absorption in each other. We’re drunk on the sight of each other, cataloguing the myriad points on which we are the same and the few tiny differences, obsessively.
“You’re just like me,” we keep telling each other.
When she asks my name and I say, ‘Narcisse,’ she laughs delightedly, getting the reference at once: Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection and died for love of himself.
She tells me hers is ‘Belle,’ which I know means beautiful; I’m not sure whether or not she’s lying but I like the inference, so I call her Belle anyway.
A little later and we’re sitting so close she’s practically on my lap, kissing avidly.
“Bet you’d fuck yourself if you could, wouldn’t you?” she says.
“Of course I would. Wouldn’t you?” She nods, unabashed. “Want to find out what it feels like?”
She nods again, runs a fingertip up my thigh as she leans in to whisper, “Your place or mine?”
My place then, the bedroom lights blazing so we can see every minute detail of each other as we undress, touch, explore. Every inch of her body looks strangely familiar. I lick each smooth expanse of skin as I uncover it, mapping the territory as I go, noting each hair and freckle. She shivers with arousal as I kiss her neck and then on downward, cupping a breast and sucking the nipple; she moans and I feel it harden against my tongue. Her responsiveness pleases me and my own nipples stiffen in sympathy, as if what I’m doing to her is physically mirrored in my own trembling flesh. I suck harder, my hands encircling her waist and running down over her hips.
I kiss and lick my way down her taut stomach, feeling it ripple at my light touch, then slide her panties down to her thighs and gaze at her pussy, enthralled. A neat tuft of blonde curls crowns her smooth, plump-lipped cunt. It’s like looking at myself from an angle I’ve never experienced before. I stare and stare until the intensity makes her fidget and she breaks the spell by pulling me onto the bed, breathless and flushed.
“What do you like?” she asks; meaning: how shall I get you off?
“You know what I like,” I reply, meaning: we’re the same. I like what you like.
Turns out I’m both right and wrong. She starts out gentle and teasing, kissing and licking around the edge of my skimpy panties, sucking my inner thigh, then licking me through the thin fabric until I’m dripping. By the time she peels my panties off and skims a fingertip along the slippery groove between my lips, I’m fighting the urge to tell her faster, harder, fuck me now! But it seems the teasing is what I wanted after all. Her touch is insistent, hypnotic, a slow build to a long drawn-out orgasm that has me screaming when she finally lets me come with three fingers plunging into my drenched hole and her lips suctioned around my clit.
I roll her onto her back and straddle her, kissing her insatiably, licking my cream from her lips. Pulling back to look into her eyes, I’m giddy with lust. For one vertiginous moment I feel as if I’m falling into a mirror, fucking myself into insanity.
Now all I can think about is tasting her. I spin around into a sixty-nine so I can hover my pussy over her face, too sensitive from my orgasm for much contact but shivering with arousal as she flicks her tongue delicately over my folds. My approach is more direct, more brutal; she’s shown me how she likes to be touched and now I’m teaching her my way. Spreading her open with my fingers, I swipe my tongue across her clit, over and over, relentless. My elbows pin her knees apart, my weight pinioning her so however much she squirms, she can’t escape the overpowering sensations. When she’s moaning and babbling deliriously, her hips juddering as she tries to hump up against my tongue, I thrust two fingers from each hand inside her, stretching her open and curling them to seek out her G-spot. Her hips buck so hard she nearly throws me off her as she comes, soaking my hands. She tastes just like me and that thought, coupled with the way she sucks fiercely at my cunt as she loses it, makes me come again.
We lie facing each other, and gaze into each other’s eyes, absorbing this information, the new things we’ve learned about ourselves from each other.
“I never knew I could come like that,” she says, wonderingly.
“I never knew I liked to be teased so much,” I laugh. She reaches for me again, kissing me hard as she slides one leg between my thighs, hooking the other over my hip. A little shuffling and we’re grinding together, pussy to pussy, both so hot and wet. There’s just enough friction to drive me out of my mind, my clit throbbing as I rub against her, hips moving in tight circles. This time, coming feels like hurtling down a long, dark tunnel into an explosion of light. I don’t know if the hammering against my chest is her heart or mine. The sense of consummation is profound.
We’ve been kissing and fingering, licking and sucking and fucking each other for so many hours it’s daylight when we finally disengage, blissed out and exhausted.
“Can I see you again,” she asks.
“You’ll see me every time you look in the mirror,” I reply.Watching your wife get fucked by another man is a real thrill, there is no doubt about that. But there are some cucks who want to take it even further. How can you go further than fucking? Cucks like me, we don’t just want our wives to cheat on us with their bodies. What we long for, more than anything else, is for our wives to develop real feelings for the bull.
It is called emotional cuckoldry. And it is not for the faint of heart. It is for people who are willing to really test their own inner strength. Maybe you suspect that it would be nice to watch your wife falling for another. I mean, it brings the excitement of competition to the surface, after all. But then, your heart gets kind of stamped on as she reveals to you the truth — that not only does he have a bigger cock than you, but he has also managed to awaken a real heart connection in her. Yes, that’s exciting too. But it is also incredibly scary. It means she might leave you.
And this is the real juice.
We emotional cuckolds must have had some abandonment issues in the past. And this fear of abandonment somehow is fused in our psyche with eroticism. So when the idea that our wife might leave first presents itself, the lump we feel in our throat is like nothing else. It unearths a desire and an excitement in us that is reckless — almost unlawful. Certainly taboo. We are not supposed to enjoy this. We must be masochistic, though, because we do. It hurts so good. So good.
It first happened to me with Ben, a guy that my wife had started fooling around with at work.
I knew she had a crush on him, that much she had confessed to me. But she hadn’t told me any of the details. I had assured her it was OK for her to pursue this crush, but she didn’t trust me, I guess. But finally, we had a date night, planned a week in advance, and I was able to get some of the details out of her.
It was dinner at The Corner Place, our favorite casual but awesome Italian. I waited until we had both ordered and had sipped a little red wine. Then I hit her with it.
“So, Lexy,” I said. “I’ve known you for a long time. You know, three years before we even started dating. Three years of dating. One year of marriage. That’s seven years.”
“Uh huh. Good math skills.”
She’s funny, I’ll give her that.
“I know you honey,” I said. “You can’t, you know…”
“I can’t what?”
“Well, I know you. And I would know if you weren’t, you know, telling me everything…”
“Oh, can we not talk about Ben tonight,” she said. “Can we just have a date night, me and you. Without Ben.”
“Of course.”
Shut down.
She shut me right down. Now I had to sit with these feelings. She was totally cheating on me. I mean, I knew she was cheating on me. But even this, being totally cheated on by the person who was cheating on me, by her withholding the details. Even this, I loved it.
It was a tortuous but lovely feeling.
We got through the whole date night. Got in bed, and I started making love to her. And as I was going down on her, I said, “Mmm, this tastes so good.” And then I just coyly asked her, “Has Ben tasted how good this tastes?”
“Mmmhmmm,” she murmured.
“I’m sorry,” I said, between licks of her clit. “Was that a yes?”
“Mmmmhmm,” she said.
“When did the lucky boy taste that?” I said, coming up for air.
“A couple days ago,” she gasped; she was almost ready to climax now. “We went back to his apartment at lunch. He wanted to fuck me. But I couldn’t.”
“So he just ate you,” I said.
“Mmmhmmm.”
“Did you cum?”
“Mmmhmmm.”
“And…”
“Oh shut up, I’m going to cum!”
And I concentrated on my work and made her cum real well. Then she went down and started reciprocating on my cock.
“Ah, and has Ben been as lucky as me in this regard?” I asked.
“Oh Jesus,” she said. “I’m trying to suck a dick here. Are you going to interrogate me or do you want a blow job?”
“Just nod or shake your head. Have you sucked his dick?”
She nodded.
I felt so good then. We were complete again. We weren’t holding anything back.
“Was it a nice dick?”
She shrugged her shoulders, then she nodded. I guessed it was a pretty nice dick.
“Bigger or smaller than mine?”
She made a kind of sing-songy noise. I didn’t hear it at first. But when she repeated it, I took her to be sing-songing “a little bigger.”
“A little bigger?”
She nodded.
“That’s good. That’s very good.”
It was so good in fact that I shot my load right then.
She was pissed.
“Josh!” she said. “I wanted to get fucked! I really wanted you to fuck me on our date night. Damn it.”
She got in bed next to me. But she wasn’t the one who should be pissed. It was her fault. She’d never told me this. And then, to find it out this way, through my subterfuge, it was all so exciting, I couldn’t help myself when I finally saw her nodding and admitting to a blow job. I just came like crazy.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” I said, finally asking the question that had been hanging between us.
“I’m sorry honey,” she said. “I just…I just didn’t feel like…you know, going through the details…I wanted it to be something…private, between me and Ben. Just this one private thing. I mean, I think that’s all it’s ever going to be. I don’t think I can bring myself to fuck him. So he ate my pussy and he made me cum and I sucked his cock and I made him cum, but–”
“Did he cum in your mouth?”
“See,” she said.
“See what?”
“This! I mean, I thought we could do this, Josh. I thought you could be…cooler about it. But maybe you can’t…handle it, I don’t know. I am going to call the whole thing off.”
“No! I can handle it!” I panicked. I was anxious that she was going to call the whole thing off. That was the last thing I wanted. “I don’t want you to call it off.”
It was then that she just broke down crying like crazy. I thought it was all my fault.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” I said to her. But through her blubbering, I gathered that it wasn’t my fault.
“What is it, then?” I asked.
“Oh, Josh,” she said. “I am so sorry. But…I think I’m falling in love with him. I’m sorry!”
“In love with Ben?”
“Yes,” she cried. “I’ve had a crush on him for months, yes. But now that we have been fooling around, Josh, I feel different with him, to how I feel with you. I’m so sorry. I feel…in my heart for him, something that I guess I didn’t know was there. But I think that’s what you’re supposed to feel in your heart for someone you fuck. I guess I shouldn’t have married you because I don’t feel that in my heart for you. I am so sorry. Oh God, I am so sorry about this. But it’s been driving me crazy and I’ve just got to be honest and tell you.”
“Tell me what?” I asked.
“I don’t love you, Josh,” she said, through a river of tears. “I’m sorry, I just don’t!”
When I woke up, she was packing a bag.
“What?” I said. “What are you doing?”
“What do you think I’m doing? Did you not hear what I told you last night? Were you drunk?”
“No,” I said. “I heard everything.”
“Then you know, that’s why I’m packing. I don’t love you, Josh. I’ve got to move out.”
“No you don’t,” I said. “That’s the last thing I want.”
“Right. You want to be married to someone who doesn’t love you? How fucked up is that?”
“Well, you might think it’s fucked up,” I said. “But Lexy, you know…it’s perfect for me. In so many ways. I mean, you know my upbringing…you know what I’m used to. My family didn’t love me. They didn’t even want me. So this is exactly what I’m comfortable with. I am just glad that it’s finally out in the open. I mean, you don’t think I knew that you didn’t love me? I mean, on our wedding day you were practically making out with Srivanda out on the balcony. I saw that, you know? The reason I picked you, unconsciously or consciously, must be because I have never felt loved and I wanted to continue that with my adult family.”
“So you want to stay with me, even though I don’t love you?”
She looked at me in disbelief.
“Yes,” I cried. “I love you more than ever now. This is what I want. Unrequited love. I want to suffer. I love it.”
“You love it.”
“Oh my God, if I could somehow let you experience what I experienced last night when you confessed this all to me. If you had been able to feel my chest, the compressions there. It was so intense. And then the back of my throat. It was such a pressure. And in my balls and my cock. I started almost cumming in my pants as you detailed how much you had been faking it, and how you really didn’t love me at all. It was so intense. It was painful and for some reason, the most pleasant feeling I have ever felt. After you went to sleep last night I went to the bathroom and I beat off ten times, I was so horny. Looking at you now, I think I’m going to cum again, just seeing your loveliness, and knowing that you don’t want me — it gives you an unbelievable power, don’t you see. You’ve become…Cleopatra. Royal. Beautiful beyond belief. You’ve become divine. A Goddess I can serve, but never equal. You’ve become…my dream come true.”
She looked at me like I was totally out of my mind.
“Wow, she said. “I did not…expect that.”
She put down her bags.
“So you want me to stay?”
“Yes!” I said. “Please stay.”
“Alright,” she said, looking bewildered. “I’ll stay. For now anyhow.”
And that’s how I became an emotional cuckold. My wife didn’t tell me details about her sex with her boyfriend any more. She shared details about her emotional connection with him. How he made her feel all girlie and excited. She took me shopping when she wanted to buy him a special gift. She wrote me emails and even handwritten letters about what a crush she had on him, how sexy he was, and how wonderful and special a person he was. She drew little hearts. She put her name and his name inside the heart. She took loads of special selfies of the two of them hugging and she sent them all to me. She shared herself and her affair with me totally. Even more than totally. I had the feeling that she was exaggerating a lot of it just because she understood me so perfectly. She knew that the worse she made it for me, the more jealous and shut out I felt, the more excited I got. And she took me there. All the way. She gave me the ultimate thrill. She made me into an emotional cuckold.
My wife. I love her so!2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.

I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.
Follow MyErotica for refined erotic fiction to ignite your deepest desires.Shallow breaths
As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
HeThe first time, I was pretty sure I was seeing things. I was in my towel, fresh out the shower, ready to pick my undies before heading out for my uni class in town. Deciding what to wear, I had this vague, mostly subconscious sense that my bras and panties weren’t quite laid out how they were the previous morning.
The second time, I was convinced someone had been in my panty drawer. Some of my panties and thongs we definitely not arranged how I’d left them.
I felt pissed. Which of my housemates was going through my personal stuff? There were five of us living together. Two girls, three guys. None of them seemed the sort who’d go through my lingerie. Then again: how would I know?
The third time I caught him. Sat on my bed, with my favorite black lace panties wrapped around his cock. He was pumping himself hard and fast.
“What the fuck, James?” I said angrily, turning on the light.
“Shit,” was all he managed. And then again: “Shit.”
I’ve never seen anyone look so panicked. Deer in the headlights didn’t come close to it.
He took my panties off his cock, left them on my bed, and zipped himself back up. Then, unable to look me in the eyes, he walked straight past me, head down, and up to his top floor bedroom.
Two hours later I was lying in bed, unable to sleep.
The anger had subsided. Bizarrely, the initial feelings of violation had now turned to intrigue.
I’d never thought of any of my housemates as anything but friends. And now suddenly I couldn’t help but think about James differently.
He was into me.
My thoughts lingered for a moment on seeing his cock.
Out of nowhere, I felt a slight shudder of pleasure go through me thinking about my sexiest panties wrapped around it. Without even realizing, my hand had slipped down between my legs.
What was I thinking? I was shocked at myself. I wanted to feel angry again. That was the normal response I should be having. Right? But I couldn’t get the anger back. Suddenly the whole thing felt thrilling.
Before I could stop myself, I picked up my phone. And I texted him.
“Next time, just ask, okay?”
My heart was racing. What was I doing? I felt instant regret.
Then I heard my phone beep.
“Next time?”
Out of nowhere I felt this longing to see his cock again. With my panties wrapped around it. I wanted to watch him do it.
“How about now?” I wrote impulsively.
“?” he replied instantly.
Did I really want to do this? What was I getting myself into?
Fuck it, I thought.
“Come down and play with my panties again…while I watch,” I texted.
My left hand was rubbing my clit through my panties as I typed on the phone with my right. I hadn’t felt turned on like this in ages. Maybe never quite like this.
My phone beeped again.
“Are you serious?”
I found myself getting almost annoyed at his hesitancy, firing off an instant reply.
“Yes! Now get the fuck down here already.”
I heard the floorboards creak. His room was directly above mine. And then his slow footsteps down the stairs. He knocked gently on my door. Walked in, smiling sheepishly.
He didn’t know what to say.
“I want to watch you jerk off in my panties,” I told him, suddenly feeling bold in a way that surprised me.
I lifted the bedcover off and moved so I was sitting on top of it instead. I indicated for him to come and sit next to me. He was still fully dressed and clearly nervous. I found it quite endearing. And it made me want to take charge like I never had before.
“Take your jeans and boxers off,” I told him.
He could hardly look at me, but did it immediately. I smiled when I saw his cock. So big and hard. Maybe he was nervous, but he was as turned on as I was.
“Now take my panties off for me.”
He looked at me, stunned. I could tell he was about to come out with this ‘are you serious’ line again, so I didn’t let him.
“Yes, I’m serious. Take them off. I want you to use these when you jerk off.”
I knelt up. He moved towards me. He slid his hands up the outside of my thighs, under my short nightdress, and up to my black panties. Yes, the ones I’d caught him playing with before.
Feeling his hands on me was mesmerizing. It was tempting to just have sex. But I was determined to watch him play with himself in my panties.
He peeled my panties off me. Instinctively he moved them straight to his face. I totally got off on watching him sniff my panties. I’d never even thought about anything like this and now it was driving my imagination wild.
Then he took my panties and, while looking into my eyes, wrapped them around his oh-so-delicious looking cock.
Instantly he let out a quiet moan as he touched himself for the first time.
I felt so wet that I was sure I was dripping.
I watched him rub himself slowly with my panties. I wasn’t even sure why this was such a turn on. But it was.
I sat on my bed, back to the wall, and parted my legs. I began to play with myself as he sat on the side of my bed rubbing himself harder and faster.
When he turned and saw me, his eyes widened.
“Fuuuucck,” I heard him whisper.
I could tell he was about to come soon.
I was desperate to see him come all over my panties. I don’t even know why. But I wanted it so badly. Needed it.
And then he did.
His body convulsed in front of me. And I watched as he came, covering my panties. I felt myself getting close to my own orgasm now too.
Another thought flashed into my mind.
“Lick my panties,” I told him. “I want to watch you lick your own cum out of my panties.”
James was so turned on he would have done anything.
And he did.
I watched him lick my panties, feeling more aroused than ever in my life.
“Now come and lick me.”
He didn’t hesitate. He lay between my legs, and moved his mouth to my pussy. I grabbed his head, pulling him tight towards me.
It didn’t take long. I was ready. Barely a minute after his tongue moved around my clit, I was ready to explode.
I squirted all over his face.
I’d never squirted before.I expect my Master soon
and knowing His pleasures, I must
prepare myself for His arrival.
I see myself reflected,
corsetted tight and waist nipped in
black, the way He wants me.
I look to check that
seams are straight and too high heels that
thrust my body into provocation.
I scent the room and
light soft candles, making shadows play upon
the body that will be His to use.
I find His ballgag and
part my lips to take it deep, and tighten the strap
so my cheeks bulge with violation.
I ensure His whip is hanging
where He may reach it when need arouses
and mark me in ways He pleases.
I caress the steel of cuffs
between my fingers, wanting to see them
glittering against yielding skin.
I feel compulsion in His iron bed
that will welcome my spread-eagled body
each shackle open with invitation.
I reach down to encircle ankles
to hear the sound of metal closing
moistening me wide for surrender.
I strain above my head to reach the bars
stretched tight is the way He wants me, I must
tighten steel upon my wrists.
I am here for Him now
knowing not when He will come, only that desire
will grow with the waiting.
I can only stare upwards
knowing that when He comes,
I will be only His.
101 Poems for kinky lovers, by Francesca Anderssen is available in paperback and on the Amazon kindle marketplace.Take me as your very own
tie me as your love demands
use me now and use me fully
force me down to your commands
I need to know your chains upon me
such craving there will always be
to want your ropes to hurt my body
so your bonds will set me free
Submission is my total needing
wanting you to make it so
taking me to places strangely
where I cannot help but go
You’re the one who now must hold me
I’ve sold myself to your control
with my freedom gone forever
now that you possess my soul
So tie me tighter yet and tighter
my screams must bite the gag you give
use my mind to make me suffer
this is how I want to live.

Mimi Bordeaux
Nov 7, 2016
Audrey is sitting in a cocktail lounge. She’s sipping her Cosmo, thinking to herself, ‘I deserve a night out. I work hard. It will be nice to enjoy a few drinks.’ She’s happy with her attire and looks elegant. She’s wearing a little black dress with a strand of pearls and her hair is tied up in a French roll.
A plain looking girl enters the bar. She never goes to bars but tonight she’s decided to be adventurous as it’s a warm summer evening. As she walks in she looks around nervously for an empty table. She is thinking, ‘I want to have an encounter… with anyone.’ She has never been in a proper relationship and at 26 she thinks it’s time.
She’s ordering her drink at the bar — a Shirley Temple — when she notices the elegant woman sitting there. Audrey is lost in her own thoughts, but her interest is piqued by Jane’s request for the non-alcoholic drink. She swings her bar stool around to look at her.
Jane summons up the courage to blurt out, “Oh hello… do you come here often?” She feels like a fool for her clichéd opening gambit, but she continues anyway. “I don’t usually go to bars, but here I am.”
Audrey coolly replies, “I like to go out alone and have a few drinks by myself.” She looks Jane up and down, notices that she’s actually rather sweet looking despite her plain clothes, senses her air of barely contained excitement. Her tone becomes warmer. “It’s quite dull here actually. How about you come back to my place and tell me all about yourself?”
“There’s not much to tell,” Jane says nervously, but before she really knows what’s happening she’s agreed to go back to Audrey’s place anyway.
It’s not far by taxi to Audrey’s luxurious apartment. ‘Oh, this is exciting!’ Jane thinks to herself. She still lives with her mother in an ordinary suburban house. Audrey offers her a drink and tells her to make herself comfortable, while she gets changed. She disappears through the double doors leading to her bedroom. Jane looks around; she’s never seen such opulence and she thinks Audrey must be very worldly.
Audrey returns. She has been busy putting on her outfit. She stands there, imposing, looking even taller in fishnet stockings and thigh high leather boots with spike heels. Her black corset barely contains her voluptuous breasts. She is wearing a dog collar around her neck and a black leather mask. She holds a black whip which she flicks every second.
She stares at Jane and says, “Go through that door,” gesturing towards a red leather door off the bedroom with the whip. Jane’s heart is racing. She’s apprehensive but excited by Audrey’s domineering tone. She does as she’s told and enters the room with Audrey following, flicking the whip at her behind. First softly, then a hard crack that stings Jane’s buttocks.
Jane perches on a stool in the middle of the room, the only place to sit, and glances around at her surroundings. Chains, ropes and leather straps hang from the ceiling and walls. She shivers at the sight.
Audrey slams the door shut and barks, “Did I give you permission to sit down?” Jane is confused. Audrey walks toward her, flicking the whip, and stands over her. “Open your legs.” Jane does as she’s told. “Are you getting wet? You must be excited.” Jane squirms, feeling wetness between the tops of her thighs. She’s never felt this way before. There’s a tingling sensation she can’t fathom. It’s because of Audrey.
Jane looks up. Audrey is staring at her and in a second has Jane’s head in her hands. She swipes her tongue up Jane’s cheek then to her mouth, biting hard on the lower lip. She rolls her tongue around Jane’s lips and forcefully enters her mouth, her tongue pushing in deep, grabbing onto Jane’s tongue with her teeth.
Audrey kneels, pulls Jane’s skirt and panties off and moves her head between Jane’s legs. Jane is quivering and needs to hold onto something but there’s nothing except Audrey. She puts her hands on Audrey’s head, winds her fingers into the elegantly coiffured hair. Audrey licks all the way from Jane’s asshole to her clit. She sticks her tongue in Jane’s cunt. In out, in out. She does it over and over again, licking Jane’s whole crack and tongue-fucking her deeper and deeper. Then she focuses on Jane’s clit, licking more softly.
Jane is overwhelmed by the attention and instinctively opens her legs wider. Audrey sucks and nibbles on her swollen clit, licking voraciously. Jane’s head is swimming, she thinks she may faint and her legs are trembling uncontrollably. There’s a fluttering in her stomach like an eel spinning around. She’s sweating, her chest is burning and her face is flushed. She’s on the verge of something, a sensation she’s never felt before. It’s building up from her toes, up her legs; between them she feels a gush of fluid. Suddenly she throws her head back, straining, her eyes tight shut; she grabs Audrey’s head and makes a high-pitched involuntary screech. She can’t think, see or hear any more, but she’s screaming out her pleasure as she slides off the stool.
“Shut up!” Audrey says harshly, pulling her to her feet and leading her by the neck to some ropes hanging from the ceiling. She ties Jane’s hands tightly and tells her to bend over. Jane is giddy, but she does as she’s told. There’s a sound behind her, then she feels something touching her cunt. It thrusts inside her, going right to the hilt, then out again. It goes in again and starts to move slowly, in out, in out. Jane moans as the thrusting becomes more intense.
Now it’s moving more quickly, sending waves of heat up Jane’s body. She moans and whispers, “Yes… oh yes!” as Audrey pumps her cunt with force. Audrey slams the dildo in, pressing at a special spot that has Jane intoxicated. Jane can’t hold back any longer and yells out, clutching at the rope, sweat dripping from her forehead, her cunt soaking wet and squirting juices that dribble down her thighs.
Audrey turns Jane around and thrusts the dildo into her mouth, making her gag for a moment before she adjusts to its size. “Suck!” says Audrey sternly. The dildo is coated with cum and Jane tastes her own juice for the first time.
Audrey unties Jane’s wrists and buckles a dog collar around her neck, with a short leash attached. She leads her to a wooden table. “Bend over and put your ass in the air, slut,” she commands her. The words have an instant effect on Jane, who feels her cunt swell and throb, more wetness trickling down her thighs. She’s so turned on.
Audrey holds onto the leash and rubs her finger against Jane’s asshole. Jane feels something cold and sticky being spread over her, and then Audrey’s fingertip wriggling into her ass. It feels strange, but good. The finger goes a little deeper, and then suddenly thrusts all the way inside. She yells.
“Shut up, slut,” Audrey says, adding a second finger and pumping them in and out of Jane’s ass. Jane lies flat against the table, ass up, and takes it. She starts to like it. She moans with each stroke.
“You like that do you, my little slut?” Audrey says, going deeper and faster. Jane is dizzy with excitement, growling and howling. Her orgasm fires through her whole body, radiating out from her core.
After a few minutes Audrey withdraws her fingers and Jane slumps down onto the table, exhausted. Audrey grabs the leash, making Jane stand, then removes the collar. She stares at Jane. She grabs her head and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck, then kisses her on the mouth.
“Time for you to go home,” she says. “You know the way out.” She marches Jane to the red door and pushes her through it, throwing her clothes after her. Jane dresses rapidly and staggers to the front door. Her pussy and ass are throbbing as she runs down the stairs. She’s floating. She feels like a bird in flight. She begins to walk.This girl looks exactly like me. The same long, wavy blonde hair. The same blue-grey eyes, the sprinkling of freckles over the bridge of her nose. The same slender fingers, moving to my nipple, as mine move to hers. We could be twins.
Only the tattoo on my back and the one on her foot mark us apart. She laughs when she undresses me and sees mine.
“Maybe I need to get one like it,” she says, getting down on her knees to kiss it, lick it; her tongue moving lower, down the cleft of my ass.
We met earlier that night, in a bar.
Coming face to face, I think for a moment that I’m walking into a mirror. We stare at each other for a long while, fascinated.
Before long we’ve both ditched our dates and are huddled in a corner, insulated from the noise of the bar by our absorption in each other. We’re drunk on the sight of each other, cataloguing the myriad points on which we are the same and the few tiny differences, obsessively.
“You’re just like me,” we keep telling each other.
When she asks my name and I say, ‘Narcisse,’ she laughs delightedly, getting the reference at once: Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection and died for love of himself.
She tells me hers is ‘Belle,’ which I know means beautiful; I’m not sure whether or not she’s lying but I like the inference, so I call her Belle anyway.
A little later and we’re sitting so close she’s practically on my lap, kissing avidly.
“Bet you’d fuck yourself if you could, wouldn’t you?” she says.
“Of course I would. Wouldn’t you?” She nods, unabashed. “Want to find out what it feels like?”
She nods again, runs a fingertip up my thigh as she leans in to whisper, “Your place or mine?”
My place then, the bedroom lights blazing so we can see every minute detail of each other as we undress, touch, explore. Every inch of her body looks strangely familiar. I lick each smooth expanse of skin as I uncover it, mapping the territory as I go, noting each hair and freckle. She shivers with arousal as I kiss her neck and then on downward, cupping a breast and sucking the nipple; she moans and I feel it harden against my tongue. Her responsiveness pleases me and my own nipples stiffen in sympathy, as if what I’m doing to her is physically mirrored in my own trembling flesh. I suck harder, my hands encircling her waist and running down over her hips.
I kiss and lick my way down her taut stomach, feeling it ripple at my light touch, then slide her panties down to her thighs and gaze at her pussy, enthralled. A neat tuft of blonde curls crowns her smooth, plump-lipped cunt. It’s like looking at myself from an angle I’ve never experienced before. I stare and stare until the intensity makes her fidget and she breaks the spell by pulling me onto the bed, breathless and flushed.
“What do you like?” she asks; meaning: how shall I get you off?
“You know what I like,” I reply, meaning: we’re the same. I like what you like.
Turns out I’m both right and wrong. She starts out gentle and teasing, kissing and licking around the edge of my skimpy panties, sucking my inner thigh, then licking me through the thin fabric until I’m dripping. By the time she peels my panties off and skims a fingertip along the slippery groove between my lips, I’m fighting the urge to tell her faster, harder, fuck me now! But it seems the teasing is what I wanted after all. Her touch is insistent, hypnotic, a slow build to a long drawn-out orgasm that has me screaming when she finally lets me come with three fingers plunging into my drenched hole and her lips suctioned around my clit.
I roll her onto her back and straddle her, kissing her insatiably, licking my cream from her lips. Pulling back to look into her eyes, I’m giddy with lust. For one vertiginous moment I feel as if I’m falling into a mirror, fucking myself into insanity.
Now all I can think about is tasting her. I spin around into a sixty-nine so I can hover my pussy over her face, too sensitive from my orgasm for much contact but shivering with arousal as she flicks her tongue delicately over my folds. My approach is more direct, more brutal; she’s shown me how she likes to be touched and now I’m teaching her my way. Spreading her open with my fingers, I swipe my tongue across her clit, over and over, relentless. My elbows pin her knees apart, my weight pinioning her so however much she squirms, she can’t escape the overpowering sensations. When she’s moaning and babbling deliriously, her hips juddering as she tries to hump up against my tongue, I thrust two fingers from each hand inside her, stretching her open and curling them to seek out her G-spot. Her hips buck so hard she nearly throws me off her as she comes, soaking my hands. She tastes just like me and that thought, coupled with the way she sucks fiercely at my cunt as she loses it, makes me come again.
We lie facing each other, and gaze into each other’s eyes, absorbing this information, the new things we’ve learned about ourselves from each other.
“I never knew I could come like that,” she says, wonderingly.
“I never knew I liked to be teased so much,” I laugh. She reaches for me again, kissing me hard as she slides one leg between my thighs, hooking the other over my hip. A little shuffling and we’re grinding together, pussy to pussy, both so hot and wet. There’s just enough friction to drive me out of my mind, my clit throbbing as I rub against her, hips moving in tight circles. This time, coming feels like hurtling down a long, dark tunnel into an explosion of light. I don’t know if the hammering against my chest is her heart or mine. The sense of consummation is profound.
We’ve been kissing and fingering, licking and sucking and fucking each other for so many hours it’s daylight when we finally disengage, blissed out and exhausted.
“Can I see you again,” she asks.
“You’ll see me every time you look in the mirror,” I reply.Watching your wife get fucked by another man is a real thrill, there is no doubt about that. But there are some cucks who want to take it even further. How can you go further than fucking? Cucks like me, we don’t just want our wives to cheat on us with their bodies. What we long for, more than anything else, is for our wives to develop real feelings for the bull.
It is called emotional cuckoldry. And it is not for the faint of heart. It is for people who are willing to really test their own inner strength. Maybe you suspect that it would be nice to watch your wife falling for another. I mean, it brings the excitement of competition to the surface, after all. But then, your heart gets kind of stamped on as she reveals to you the truth — that not only does he have a bigger cock than you, but he has also managed to awaken a real heart connection in her. Yes, that’s exciting too. But it is also incredibly scary. It means she might leave you.
And this is the real juice.
We emotional cuckolds must have had some abandonment issues in the past. And this fear of abandonment somehow is fused in our psyche with eroticism. So when the idea that our wife might leave first presents itself, the lump we feel in our throat is like nothing else. It unearths a desire and an excitement in us that is reckless — almost unlawful. Certainly taboo. We are not supposed to enjoy this. We must be masochistic, though, because we do. It hurts so good. So good.
It first happened to me with Ben, a guy that my wife had started fooling around with at work.
I knew she had a crush on him, that much she had confessed to me. But she hadn’t told me any of the details. I had assured her it was OK for her to pursue this crush, but she didn’t trust me, I guess. But finally, we had a date night, planned a week in advance, and I was able to get some of the details out of her.
It was dinner at The Corner Place, our favorite casual but awesome Italian. I waited until we had both ordered and had sipped a little red wine. Then I hit her with it.
“So, Lexy,” I said. “I’ve known you for a long time. You know, three years before we even started dating. Three years of dating. One year of marriage. That’s seven years.”
“Uh huh. Good math skills.”
She’s funny, I’ll give her that.
“I know you honey,” I said. “You can’t, you know…”
“I can’t what?”
“Well, I know you. And I would know if you weren’t, you know, telling me everything…”
“Oh, can we not talk about Ben tonight,” she said. “Can we just have a date night, me and you. Without Ben.”
“Of course.”
Shut down.
She shut me right down. Now I had to sit with these feelings. She was totally cheating on me. I mean, I knew she was cheating on me. But even this, being totally cheated on by the person who was cheating on me, by her withholding the details. Even this, I loved it.
It was a tortuous but lovely feeling.
We got through the whole date night. Got in bed, and I started making love to her. And as I was going down on her, I said, “Mmm, this tastes so good.” And then I just coyly asked her, “Has Ben tasted how good this tastes?”
“Mmmhmmm,” she murmured.
“I’m sorry,” I said, between licks of her clit. “Was that a yes?”
“Mmmmhmm,” she said.
“When did the lucky boy taste that?” I said, coming up for air.
“A couple days ago,” she gasped; she was almost ready to climax now. “We went back to his apartment at lunch. He wanted to fuck me. But I couldn’t.”
“So he just ate you,” I said.
“Mmmhmmm.”
“Did you cum?”
“Mmmhmmm.”
“And…”
“Oh shut up, I’m going to cum!”
And I concentrated on my work and made her cum real well. Then she went down and started reciprocating on my cock.
“Ah, and has Ben been as lucky as me in this regard?” I asked.
“Oh Jesus,” she said. “I’m trying to suck a dick here. Are you going to interrogate me or do you want a blow job?”
“Just nod or shake your head. Have you sucked his dick?”
She nodded.
I felt so good then. We were complete again. We weren’t holding anything back.
“Was it a nice dick?”
She shrugged her shoulders, then she nodded. I guessed it was a pretty nice dick.
“Bigger or smaller than mine?”
She made a kind of sing-songy noise. I didn’t hear it at first. But when she repeated it, I took her to be sing-songing “a little bigger.”
“A little bigger?”
She nodded.
“That’s good. That’s very good.”
It was so good in fact that I shot my load right then.
She was pissed.
“Josh!” she said. “I wanted to get fucked! I really wanted you to fuck me on our date night. Damn it.”
She got in bed next to me. But she wasn’t the one who should be pissed. It was her fault. She’d never told me this. And then, to find it out this way, through my subterfuge, it was all so exciting, I couldn’t help myself when I finally saw her nodding and admitting to a blow job. I just came like crazy.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” I said, finally asking the question that had been hanging between us.
“I’m sorry honey,” she said. “I just…I just didn’t feel like…you know, going through the details…I wanted it to be something…private, between me and Ben. Just this one private thing. I mean, I think that’s all it’s ever going to be. I don’t think I can bring myself to fuck him. So he ate my pussy and he made me cum and I sucked his cock and I made him cum, but–”
“Did he cum in your mouth?”
“See,” she said.
“See what?”
“This! I mean, I thought we could do this, Josh. I thought you could be…cooler about it. But maybe you can’t…handle it, I don’t know. I am going to call the whole thing off.”
“No! I can handle it!” I panicked. I was anxious that she was going to call the whole thing off. That was the last thing I wanted. “I don’t want you to call it off.”
It was then that she just broke down crying like crazy. I thought it was all my fault.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” I said to her. But through her blubbering, I gathered that it wasn’t my fault.
“What is it, then?” I asked.
“Oh, Josh,” she said. “I am so sorry. But…I think I’m falling in love with him. I’m sorry!”
“In love with Ben?”
“Yes,” she cried. “I’ve had a crush on him for months, yes. But now that we have been fooling around, Josh, I feel different with him, to how I feel with you. I’m so sorry. I feel…in my heart for him, something that I guess I didn’t know was there. But I think that’s what you’re supposed to feel in your heart for someone you fuck. I guess I shouldn’t have married you because I don’t feel that in my heart for you. I am so sorry. Oh God, I am so sorry about this. But it’s been driving me crazy and I’ve just got to be honest and tell you.”
“Tell me what?” I asked.
“I don’t love you, Josh,” she said, through a river of tears. “I’m sorry, I just don’t!”
When I woke up, she was packing a bag.
“What?” I said. “What are you doing?”
“What do you think I’m doing? Did you not hear what I told you last night? Were you drunk?”
“No,” I said. “I heard everything.”
“Then you know, that’s why I’m packing. I don’t love you, Josh. I’ve got to move out.”
“No you don’t,” I said. “That’s the last thing I want.”
“Right. You want to be married to someone who doesn’t love you? How fucked up is that?”
“Well, you might think it’s fucked up,” I said. “But Lexy, you know…it’s perfect for me. In so many ways. I mean, you know my upbringing…you know what I’m used to. My family didn’t love me. They didn’t even want me. So this is exactly what I’m comfortable with. I am just glad that it’s finally out in the open. I mean, you don’t think I knew that you didn’t love me? I mean, on our wedding day you were practically making out with Srivanda out on the balcony. I saw that, you know? The reason I picked you, unconsciously or consciously, must be because I have never felt loved and I wanted to continue that with my adult family.”
“So you want to stay with me, even though I don’t love you?”
She looked at me in disbelief.
“Yes,” I cried. “I love you more than ever now. This is what I want. Unrequited love. I want to suffer. I love it.”
“You love it.”
“Oh my God, if I could somehow let you experience what I experienced last night when you confessed this all to me. If you had been able to feel my chest, the compressions there. It was so intense. And then the back of my throat. It was such a pressure. And in my balls and my cock. I started almost cumming in my pants as you detailed how much you had been faking it, and how you really didn’t love me at all. It was so intense. It was painful and for some reason, the most pleasant feeling I have ever felt. After you went to sleep last night I went to the bathroom and I beat off ten times, I was so horny. Looking at you now, I think I’m going to cum again, just seeing your loveliness, and knowing that you don’t want me — it gives you an unbelievable power, don’t you see. You’ve become…Cleopatra. Royal. Beautiful beyond belief. You’ve become divine. A Goddess I can serve, but never equal. You’ve become…my dream come true.”
She looked at me like I was totally out of my mind.
“Wow, she said. “I did not…expect that.”
She put down her bags.
“So you want me to stay?”
“Yes!” I said. “Please stay.”
“Alright,” she said, looking bewildered. “I’ll stay. For now anyhow.”
And that’s how I became an emotional cuckold. My wife didn’t tell me details about her sex with her boyfriend any more. She shared details about her emotional connection with him. How he made her feel all girlie and excited. She took me shopping when she wanted to buy him a special gift. She wrote me emails and even handwritten letters about what a crush she had on him, how sexy he was, and how wonderful and special a person he was. She drew little hearts. She put her name and his name inside the heart. She took loads of special selfies of the two of them hugging and she sent them all to me. She shared herself and her affair with me totally. Even more than totally. I had the feeling that she was exaggerating a lot of it just because she understood me so perfectly. She knew that the worse she made it for me, the more jealous and shut out I felt, the more excited I got. And she took me there. All the way. She gave me the ultimate thrill. She made me into an emotional cuckold.
My wife. I love her so!I’m walking behind this girl in skintight yoga pants as she leaves the gym, watching her ass shimmy with every step she takes. I’m so mesmerized by the ripple effect that I barely even notice where I’m going. Does my ass jiggle like that when I walk? I can hardly grab it in the street to find out, but it doesn’t feel like it does. Now I’d like to grab her ass and feel her flesh bounce and shake as she sits on my face…
She goes into a coffee shop, and I follow, suddenly seized by a craving for caffeine (and pussy). She sits at a table by the window, catches my eye and smiles invitingly. I’m surprised I don’t recognize her — I thought I knew all the hot girls at my gym — but when I ask if I can join her, the effusive response makes it clear she’s noticed me before.
The morning’s progression is no less enjoyable for being entirely predictable. I’m in my comfort zone here, seducing cute girls being one of my favorite pastimes. Another coffee? Flirtatious chat. Her hand brushes my thigh as she leans across me to reach for the sugar, and she lets it linger there for a moment. Lunch? She lives nearby, she could make us something to eat…
I’ve been looking forward to peeling down those tight yoga pants, but as soon as we get inside her apartment she gives me a quick, promising kiss on the lips, and tells me she wants my opinion on her new outfit. She disappears into the bedroom, leaving me tingling pleasurably with anticipation; and returns a few moments later looking like a walking wet dream. Black lace lingerie, lace-topped stockings, garter belt, high heels; it might be a cliché, but it suits her hourglass figure perfectly. The panties cup her pussy so snugly I can see the hint of a cameltoe, and have a thong back that leaves her magnificent ass cheeks exposed.
Let’s find out what else makes her ass jiggle…
I soon reach the conclusion that those panties look even better around her thighs as I bend her forward over the couch and slot my tongue inside her creamy cunt. She’s so wet I don’t waste any more time with teasing, sucking up her sweetness, licking and rubbing until any hint of nervous inhibition has dissolved under my oral onslaught and she’s moaning and mashing her soaking pussy against my face. I adore feeling a girl shake apart as I eat her out, and I have a feeling I can guess what will push her over the edge.
I pull her panties right down so she can step out of them, then spread her legs — and her cheeks — wider. I was right, she goes wild as I paint her wetness up her ass crack with my tongue, lapping at the tight pucker until I feel her entire body shivering. I press deeper, opening her up little by little. Her legs are quivering, her booty quaking delightfully against my face, and as the tip of my tongue breaches that tight ring of muscle she has one of the fiercest assgasms I’ve ever given a girl, without any significant penetration.
Her legs are too wobbly to support her after that, so I lie back and pull her onto my face, sucking on her clit as I thrust a finger all the way into her ass. It feels almost impossibly tight at first, but a string of mini orgasms courtesy of my lashing tongue makes her loosen up, and then the way she squirms and squeals as I finger-fuck her ass lets me know I’m hitting the spot. But she really goes crazy when I turn her around so she’s sitting her ass on my face in a squat position and grind my knuckles over her clit as I lick her asshole as hard and deep as I can. I’m lucky she doesn’t suffocate me as she sags down on top of me, her body jerking convulsively… although it wouldn’t be a bad way to go, surrounded by twitching girl-flesh.
As first dates go, that was pretty intense. She’s too dazed (and, I suspect, inexperienced in the ways of lady lovin’) to get me off very effectively with her tongue and fingers, so I’m still horny as I go home and make what under the circumstances I can only describe as a “booty call” to my fuck buddy Tony.
I’m stripped down to my G-string, looking at my ass in the full-length mirror in my bedroom, as he answers the phone.
“Tony, does my ass jiggle?” I ask him, in lieu of saying hello. I bounce up and down a bit on the bed, watching for the ripple effect.
“No,” he replies, “your ass is a firm little peach, baby.”
“Not even when I go on the elliptical trainer at the gym?” I ask, vaguely disappointed.
“No. By the way, you know I’m at work, right? Can we not discuss your sexy ass and all the things I’d like to do to it right now, please.”
“Not even when you bend me over and fuck me from behind?”
“No, but it jiggles when I spank it, and you’d better believe you’re going to get a good hard spanking later!” he growls, hanging up.
So now I have my second challenge of the day: can I wait until Tony gets here to spank me until my cheeks are glowing and then fuck me hard enough to make them ripple like jello?
Or…2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.

I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.
Follow MyErotica for refined erotic fiction to ignite your deepest desires.Shallow breaths
As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
HeThe first time, I was pretty sure I was seeing things. I was in my towel, fresh out the shower, ready to pick my undies before heading out for my uni class in town. Deciding what to wear, I had this vague, mostly subconscious sense that my bras and panties weren’t quite laid out how they were the previous morning.
The second time, I was convinced someone had been in my panty drawer. Some of my panties and thongs we definitely not arranged how I’d left them.
I felt pissed. Which of my housemates was going through my personal stuff? There were five of us living together. Two girls, three guys. None of them seemed the sort who’d go through my lingerie. Then again: how would I know?
The third time I caught him. Sat on my bed, with my favorite black lace panties wrapped around his cock. He was pumping himself hard and fast.
“What the fuck, James?” I said angrily, turning on the light.
“Shit,” was all he managed. And then again: “Shit.”
I’ve never seen anyone look so panicked. Deer in the headlights didn’t come close to it.
He took my panties off his cock, left them on my bed, and zipped himself back up. Then, unable to look me in the eyes, he walked straight past me, head down, and up to his top floor bedroom.
Two hours later I was lying in bed, unable to sleep.
The anger had subsided. Bizarrely, the initial feelings of violation had now turned to intrigue.
I’d never thought of any of my housemates as anything but friends. And now suddenly I couldn’t help but think about James differently.
He was into me.
My thoughts lingered for a moment on seeing his cock.
Out of nowhere, I felt a slight shudder of pleasure go through me thinking about my sexiest panties wrapped around it. Without even realizing, my hand had slipped down between my legs.
What was I thinking? I was shocked at myself. I wanted to feel angry again. That was the normal response I should be having. Right? But I couldn’t get the anger back. Suddenly the whole thing felt thrilling.
Before I could stop myself, I picked up my phone. And I texted him.
“Next time, just ask, okay?”
My heart was racing. What was I doing? I felt instant regret.
Then I heard my phone beep.
“Next time?”
Out of nowhere I felt this longing to see his cock again. With my panties wrapped around it. I wanted to watch him do it.
“How about now?” I wrote impulsively.
“?” he replied instantly.
Did I really want to do this? What was I getting myself into?
Fuck it, I thought.
“Come down and play with my panties again…while I watch,” I texted.
My left hand was rubbing my clit through my panties as I typed on the phone with my right. I hadn’t felt turned on like this in ages. Maybe never quite like this.
My phone beeped again.
“Are you serious?”
I found myself getting almost annoyed at his hesitancy, firing off an instant reply.
“Yes! Now get the fuck down here already.”
I heard the floorboards creak. His room was directly above mine. And then his slow footsteps down the stairs. He knocked gently on my door. Walked in, smiling sheepishly.
He didn’t know what to say.
“I want to watch you jerk off in my panties,” I told him, suddenly feeling bold in a way that surprised me.
I lifted the bedcover off and moved so I was sitting on top of it instead. I indicated for him to come and sit next to me. He was still fully dressed and clearly nervous. I found it quite endearing. And it made me want to take charge like I never had before.
“Take your jeans and boxers off,” I told him.
He could hardly look at me, but did it immediately. I smiled when I saw his cock. So big and hard. Maybe he was nervous, but he was as turned on as I was.
“Now take my panties off for me.”
He looked at me, stunned. I could tell he was about to come out with this ‘are you serious’ line again, so I didn’t let him.
“Yes, I’m serious. Take them off. I want you to use these when you jerk off.”
I knelt up. He moved towards me. He slid his hands up the outside of my thighs, under my short nightdress, and up to my black panties. Yes, the ones I’d caught him playing with before.
Feeling his hands on me was mesmerizing. It was tempting to just have sex. But I was determined to watch him play with himself in my panties.
He peeled my panties off me. Instinctively he moved them straight to his face. I totally got off on watching him sniff my panties. I’d never even thought about anything like this and now it was driving my imagination wild.
Then he took my panties and, while looking into my eyes, wrapped them around his oh-so-delicious looking cock.
Instantly he let out a quiet moan as he touched himself for the first time.
I felt so wet that I was sure I was dripping.
I watched him rub himself slowly with my panties. I wasn’t even sure why this was such a turn on. But it was.
I sat on my bed, back to the wall, and parted my legs. I began to play with myself as he sat on the side of my bed rubbing himself harder and faster.
When he turned and saw me, his eyes widened.
“Fuuuucck,” I heard him whisper.
I could tell he was about to come soon.
I was desperate to see him come all over my panties. I don’t even know why. But I wanted it so badly. Needed it.
And then he did.
His body convulsed in front of me. And I watched as he came, covering my panties. I felt myself getting close to my own orgasm now too.
Another thought flashed into my mind.
“Lick my panties,” I told him. “I want to watch you lick your own cum out of my panties.”
James was so turned on he would have done anything.
And he did.
I watched him lick my panties, feeling more aroused than ever in my life.
“Now come and lick me.”
He didn’t hesitate. He lay between my legs, and moved his mouth to my pussy. I grabbed his head, pulling him tight towards me.
It didn’t take long. I was ready. Barely a minute after his tongue moved around my clit, I was ready to explode.
I squirted all over his face.
I’d never squirted before.I expect my Master soon
and knowing His pleasures, I must
prepare myself for His arrival.
I see myself reflected,
corsetted tight and waist nipped in
black, the way He wants me.
I look to check that
seams are straight and too high heels that
thrust my body into provocation.
I scent the room and
light soft candles, making shadows play upon
the body that will be His to use.
I find His ballgag and
part my lips to take it deep, and tighten the strap
so my cheeks bulge with violation.
I ensure His whip is hanging
where He may reach it when need arouses
and mark me in ways He pleases.
I caress the steel of cuffs
between my fingers, wanting to see them
glittering against yielding skin.
I feel compulsion in His iron bed
that will welcome my spread-eagled body
each shackle open with invitation.
I reach down to encircle ankles
to hear the sound of metal closing
moistening me wide for surrender.
I strain above my head to reach the bars
stretched tight is the way He wants me, I must
tighten steel upon my wrists.
I am here for Him now
knowing not when He will come, only that desire
will grow with the waiting.
I can only stare upwards
knowing that when He comes,
I will be only His.
101 Poems for kinky lovers, by Francesca Anderssen is available in paperback and on the Amazon kindle marketplace.Take me as your very own
tie me as your love demands
use me now and use me fully
force me down to your commands
I need to know your chains upon me
such craving there will always be
to want your ropes to hurt my body
so your bonds will set me free
Submission is my total needing
wanting you to make it so
taking me to places strangely
where I cannot help but go
You’re the one who now must hold me
I’ve sold myself to your control
with my freedom gone forever
now that you possess my soul
So tie me tighter yet and tighter
my screams must bite the gag you give
use my mind to make me suffer
this is how I want to live.

Mimi Bordeaux
Nov 7, 2016
Audrey is sitting in a cocktail lounge. She’s sipping her Cosmo, thinking to herself, ‘I deserve a night out. I work hard. It will be nice to enjoy a few drinks.’ She’s happy with her attire and looks elegant. She’s wearing a little black dress with a strand of pearls and her hair is tied up in a French roll.
A plain looking girl enters the bar. She never goes to bars but tonight she’s decided to be adventurous as it’s a warm summer evening. As she walks in she looks around nervously for an empty table. She is thinking, ‘I want to have an encounter… with anyone.’ She has never been in a proper relationship and at 26 she thinks it’s time.
She’s ordering her drink at the bar — a Shirley Temple — when she notices the elegant woman sitting there. Audrey is lost in her own thoughts, but her interest is piqued by Jane’s request for the non-alcoholic drink. She swings her bar stool around to look at her.
Jane summons up the courage to blurt out, “Oh hello… do you come here often?” She feels like a fool for her clichéd opening gambit, but she continues anyway. “I don’t usually go to bars, but here I am.”
Audrey coolly replies, “I like to go out alone and have a few drinks by myself.” She looks Jane up and down, notices that she’s actually rather sweet looking despite her plain clothes, senses her air of barely contained excitement. Her tone becomes warmer. “It’s quite dull here actually. How about you come back to my place and tell me all about yourself?”
“There’s not much to tell,” Jane says nervously, but before she really knows what’s happening she’s agreed to go back to Audrey’s place anyway.
It’s not far by taxi to Audrey’s luxurious apartment. ‘Oh, this is exciting!’ Jane thinks to herself. She still lives with her mother in an ordinary suburban house. Audrey offers her a drink and tells her to make herself comfortable, while she gets changed. She disappears through the double doors leading to her bedroom. Jane looks around; she’s never seen such opulence and she thinks Audrey must be very worldly.
Audrey returns. She has been busy putting on her outfit. She stands there, imposing, looking even taller in fishnet stockings and thigh high leather boots with spike heels. Her black corset barely contains her voluptuous breasts. She is wearing a dog collar around her neck and a black leather mask. She holds a black whip which she flicks every second.
She stares at Jane and says, “Go through that door,” gesturing towards a red leather door off the bedroom with the whip. Jane’s heart is racing. She’s apprehensive but excited by Audrey’s domineering tone. She does as she’s told and enters the room with Audrey following, flicking the whip at her behind. First softly, then a hard crack that stings Jane’s buttocks.
Jane perches on a stool in the middle of the room, the only place to sit, and glances around at her surroundings. Chains, ropes and leather straps hang from the ceiling and walls. She shivers at the sight.
Audrey slams the door shut and barks, “Did I give you permission to sit down?” Jane is confused. Audrey walks toward her, flicking the whip, and stands over her. “Open your legs.” Jane does as she’s told. “Are you getting wet? You must be excited.” Jane squirms, feeling wetness between the tops of her thighs. She’s never felt this way before. There’s a tingling sensation she can’t fathom. It’s because of Audrey.
Jane looks up. Audrey is staring at her and in a second has Jane’s head in her hands. She swipes her tongue up Jane’s cheek then to her mouth, biting hard on the lower lip. She rolls her tongue around Jane’s lips and forcefully enters her mouth, her tongue pushing in deep, grabbing onto Jane’s tongue with her teeth.
Audrey kneels, pulls Jane’s skirt and panties off and moves her head between Jane’s legs. Jane is quivering and needs to hold onto something but there’s nothing except Audrey. She puts her hands on Audrey’s head, winds her fingers into the elegantly coiffured hair. Audrey licks all the way from Jane’s asshole to her clit. She sticks her tongue in Jane’s cunt. In out, in out. She does it over and over again, licking Jane’s whole crack and tongue-fucking her deeper and deeper. Then she focuses on Jane’s clit, licking more softly.
Jane is overwhelmed by the attention and instinctively opens her legs wider. Audrey sucks and nibbles on her swollen clit, licking voraciously. Jane’s head is swimming, she thinks she may faint and her legs are trembling uncontrollably. There’s a fluttering in her stomach like an eel spinning around. She’s sweating, her chest is burning and her face is flushed. She’s on the verge of something, a sensation she’s never felt before. It’s building up from her toes, up her legs; between them she feels a gush of fluid. Suddenly she throws her head back, straining, her eyes tight shut; she grabs Audrey’s head and makes a high-pitched involuntary screech. She can’t think, see or hear any more, but she’s screaming out her pleasure as she slides off the stool.
“Shut up!” Audrey says harshly, pulling her to her feet and leading her by the neck to some ropes hanging from the ceiling. She ties Jane’s hands tightly and tells her to bend over. Jane is giddy, but she does as she’s told. There’s a sound behind her, then she feels something touching her cunt. It thrusts inside her, going right to the hilt, then out again. It goes in again and starts to move slowly, in out, in out. Jane moans as the thrusting becomes more intense.
Now it’s moving more quickly, sending waves of heat up Jane’s body. She moans and whispers, “Yes… oh yes!” as Audrey pumps her cunt with force. Audrey slams the dildo in, pressing at a special spot that has Jane intoxicated. Jane can’t hold back any longer and yells out, clutching at the rope, sweat dripping from her forehead, her cunt soaking wet and squirting juices that dribble down her thighs.
Audrey turns Jane around and thrusts the dildo into her mouth, making her gag for a moment before she adjusts to its size. “Suck!” says Audrey sternly. The dildo is coated with cum and Jane tastes her own juice for the first time.
Audrey unties Jane’s wrists and buckles a dog collar around her neck, with a short leash attached. She leads her to a wooden table. “Bend over and put your ass in the air, slut,” she commands her. The words have an instant effect on Jane, who feels her cunt swell and throb, more wetness trickling down her thighs. She’s so turned on.
Audrey holds onto the leash and rubs her finger against Jane’s asshole. Jane feels something cold and sticky being spread over her, and then Audrey’s fingertip wriggling into her ass. It feels strange, but good. The finger goes a little deeper, and then suddenly thrusts all the way inside. She yells.
“Shut up, slut,” Audrey says, adding a second finger and pumping them in and out of Jane’s ass. Jane lies flat against the table, ass up, and takes it. She starts to like it. She moans with each stroke.
“You like that do you, my little slut?” Audrey says, going deeper and faster. Jane is dizzy with excitement, growling and howling. Her orgasm fires through her whole body, radiating out from her core.
After a few minutes Audrey withdraws her fingers and Jane slumps down onto the table, exhausted. Audrey grabs the leash, making Jane stand, then removes the collar. She stares at Jane. She grabs her head and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck, then kisses her on the mouth.
“Time for you to go home,” she says. “You know the way out.” She marches Jane to the red door and pushes her through it, throwing her clothes after her. Jane dresses rapidly and staggers to the front door. Her pussy and ass are throbbing as she runs down the stairs. She’s floating. She feels like a bird in flight. She begins to walk.This girl looks exactly like me. The same long, wavy blonde hair. The same blue-grey eyes, the sprinkling of freckles over the bridge of her nose. The same slender fingers, moving to my nipple, as mine move to hers. We could be twins.
Only the tattoo on my back and the one on her foot mark us apart. She laughs when she undresses me and sees mine.
“Maybe I need to get one like it,” she says, getting down on her knees to kiss it, lick it; her tongue moving lower, down the cleft of my ass.
We met earlier that night, in a bar.
Coming face to face, I think for a moment that I’m walking into a mirror. We stare at each other for a long while, fascinated.
Before long we’ve both ditched our dates and are huddled in a corner, insulated from the noise of the bar by our absorption in each other. We’re drunk on the sight of each other, cataloguing the myriad points on which we are the same and the few tiny differences, obsessively.
“You’re just like me,” we keep telling each other.
When she asks my name and I say, ‘Narcisse,’ she laughs delightedly, getting the reference at once: Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection and died for love of himself.
She tells me hers is ‘Belle,’ which I know means beautiful; I’m not sure whether or not she’s lying but I like the inference, so I call her Belle anyway.
A little later and we’re sitting so close she’s practically on my lap, kissing avidly.
“Bet you’d fuck yourself if you could, wouldn’t you?” she says.
“Of course I would. Wouldn’t you?” She nods, unabashed. “Want to find out what it feels like?”
She nods again, runs a fingertip up my thigh as she leans in to whisper, “Your place or mine?”
My place then, the bedroom lights blazing so we can see every minute detail of each other as we undress, touch, explore. Every inch of her body looks strangely familiar. I lick each smooth expanse of skin as I uncover it, mapping the territory as I go, noting each hair and freckle. She shivers with arousal as I kiss her neck and then on downward, cupping a breast and sucking the nipple; she moans and I feel it harden against my tongue. Her responsiveness pleases me and my own nipples stiffen in sympathy, as if what I’m doing to her is physically mirrored in my own trembling flesh. I suck harder, my hands encircling her waist and running down over her hips.
I kiss and lick my way down her taut stomach, feeling it ripple at my light touch, then slide her panties down to her thighs and gaze at her pussy, enthralled. A neat tuft of blonde curls crowns her smooth, plump-lipped cunt. It’s like looking at myself from an angle I’ve never experienced before. I stare and stare until the intensity makes her fidget and she breaks the spell by pulling me onto the bed, breathless and flushed.
“What do you like?” she asks; meaning: how shall I get you off?
“You know what I like,” I reply, meaning: we’re the same. I like what you like.
Turns out I’m both right and wrong. She starts out gentle and teasing, kissing and licking around the edge of my skimpy panties, sucking my inner thigh, then licking me through the thin fabric until I’m dripping. By the time she peels my panties off and skims a fingertip along the slippery groove between my lips, I’m fighting the urge to tell her faster, harder, fuck me now! But it seems the teasing is what I wanted after all. Her touch is insistent, hypnotic, a slow build to a long drawn-out orgasm that has me screaming when she finally lets me come with three fingers plunging into my drenched hole and her lips suctioned around my clit.
I roll her onto her back and straddle her, kissing her insatiably, licking my cream from her lips. Pulling back to look into her eyes, I’m giddy with lust. For one vertiginous moment I feel as if I’m falling into a mirror, fucking myself into insanity.
Now all I can think about is tasting her. I spin around into a sixty-nine so I can hover my pussy over her face, too sensitive from my orgasm for much contact but shivering with arousal as she flicks her tongue delicately over my folds. My approach is more direct, more brutal; she’s shown me how she likes to be touched and now I’m teaching her my way. Spreading her open with my fingers, I swipe my tongue across her clit, over and over, relentless. My elbows pin her knees apart, my weight pinioning her so however much she squirms, she can’t escape the overpowering sensations. When she’s moaning and babbling deliriously, her hips juddering as she tries to hump up against my tongue, I thrust two fingers from each hand inside her, stretching her open and curling them to seek out her G-spot. Her hips buck so hard she nearly throws me off her as she comes, soaking my hands. She tastes just like me and that thought, coupled with the way she sucks fiercely at my cunt as she loses it, makes me come again.
We lie facing each other, and gaze into each other’s eyes, absorbing this information, the new things we’ve learned about ourselves from each other.
“I never knew I could come like that,” she says, wonderingly.
“I never knew I liked to be teased so much,” I laugh. She reaches for me again, kissing me hard as she slides one leg between my thighs, hooking the other over my hip. A little shuffling and we’re grinding together, pussy to pussy, both so hot and wet. There’s just enough friction to drive me out of my mind, my clit throbbing as I rub against her, hips moving in tight circles. This time, coming feels like hurtling down a long, dark tunnel into an explosion of light. I don’t know if the hammering against my chest is her heart or mine. The sense of consummation is profound.
We’ve been kissing and fingering, licking and sucking and fucking each other for so many hours it’s daylight when we finally disengage, blissed out and exhausted.
“Can I see you again,” she asks.
“You’ll see me every time you look in the mirror,” I reply.Watching your wife get fucked by another man is a real thrill, there is no doubt about that. But there are some cucks who want to take it even further. How can you go further than fucking? Cucks like me, we don’t just want our wives to cheat on us with their bodies. What we long for, more than anything else, is for our wives to develop real feelings for the bull.
It is called emotional cuckoldry. And it is not for the faint of heart. It is for people who are willing to really test their own inner strength. Maybe you suspect that it would be nice to watch your wife falling for another. I mean, it brings the excitement of competition to the surface, after all. But then, your heart gets kind of stamped on as she reveals to you the truth — that not only does he have a bigger cock than you, but he has also managed to awaken a real heart connection in her. Yes, that’s exciting too. But it is also incredibly scary. It means she might leave you.
And this is the real juice.
We emotional cuckolds must have had some abandonment issues in the past. And this fear of abandonment somehow is fused in our psyche with eroticism. So when the idea that our wife might leave first presents itself, the lump we feel in our throat is like nothing else. It unearths a desire and an excitement in us that is reckless — almost unlawful. Certainly taboo. We are not supposed to enjoy this. We must be masochistic, though, because we do. It hurts so good. So good.
It first happened to me with Ben, a guy that my wife had started fooling around with at work.
I knew she had a crush on him, that much she had confessed to me. But she hadn’t told me any of the details. I had assured her it was OK for her to pursue this crush, but she didn’t trust me, I guess. But finally, we had a date night, planned a week in advance, and I was able to get some of the details out of her.
It was dinner at The Corner Place, our favorite casual but awesome Italian. I waited until we had both ordered and had sipped a little red wine. Then I hit her with it.
“So, Lexy,” I said. “I’ve known you for a long time. You know, three years before we even started dating. Three years of dating. One year of marriage. That’s seven years.”
“Uh huh. Good math skills.”
She’s funny, I’ll give her that.
“I know you honey,” I said. “You can’t, you know…”
“I can’t what?”
“Well, I know you. And I would know if you weren’t, you know, telling me everything…”
“Oh, can we not talk about Ben tonight,” she said. “Can we just have a date night, me and you. Without Ben.”
“Of course.”
Shut down.
She shut me right down. Now I had to sit with these feelings. She was totally cheating on me. I mean, I knew she was cheating on me. But even this, being totally cheated on by the person who was cheating on me, by her withholding the details. Even this, I loved it.
It was a tortuous but lovely feeling.
We got through the whole date night. Got in bed, and I started making love to her. And as I was going down on her, I said, “Mmm, this tastes so good.” And then I just coyly asked her, “Has Ben tasted how good this tastes?”
“Mmmhmmm,” she murmured.
“I’m sorry,” I said, between licks of her clit. “Was that a yes?”
“Mmmmhmm,” she said.
“When did the lucky boy taste that?” I said, coming up for air.
“A couple days ago,” she gasped; she was almost ready to climax now. “We went back to his apartment at lunch. He wanted to fuck me. But I couldn’t.”
“So he just ate you,” I said.
“Mmmhmmm.”
“Did you cum?”
“Mmmhmmm.”
“And…”
“Oh shut up, I’m going to cum!”
And I concentrated on my work and made her cum real well. Then she went down and started reciprocating on my cock.
“Ah, and has Ben been as lucky as me in this regard?” I asked.
“Oh Jesus,” she said. “I’m trying to suck a dick here. Are you going to interrogate me or do you want a blow job?”
“Just nod or shake your head. Have you sucked his dick?”
She nodded.
I felt so good then. We were complete again. We weren’t holding anything back.
“Was it a nice dick?”
She shrugged her shoulders, then she nodded. I guessed it was a pretty nice dick.
“Bigger or smaller than mine?”
She made a kind of sing-songy noise. I didn’t hear it at first. But when she repeated it, I took her to be sing-songing “a little bigger.”
“A little bigger?”
She nodded.
“That’s good. That’s very good.”
It was so good in fact that I shot my load right then.
She was pissed.
“Josh!” she said. “I wanted to get fucked! I really wanted you to fuck me on our date night. Damn it.”
She got in bed next to me. But she wasn’t the one who should be pissed. It was her fault. She’d never told me this. And then, to find it out this way, through my subterfuge, it was all so exciting, I couldn’t help myself when I finally saw her nodding and admitting to a blow job. I just came like crazy.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” I said, finally asking the question that had been hanging between us.
“I’m sorry honey,” she said. “I just…I just didn’t feel like…you know, going through the details…I wanted it to be something…private, between me and Ben. Just this one private thing. I mean, I think that’s all it’s ever going to be. I don’t think I can bring myself to fuck him. So he ate my pussy and he made me cum and I sucked his cock and I made him cum, but–”
“Did he cum in your mouth?”
“See,” she said.
“See what?”
“This! I mean, I thought we could do this, Josh. I thought you could be…cooler about it. But maybe you can’t…handle it, I don’t know. I am going to call the whole thing off.”
“No! I can handle it!” I panicked. I was anxious that she was going to call the whole thing off. That was the last thing I wanted. “I don’t want you to call it off.”
It was then that she just broke down crying like crazy. I thought it was all my fault.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” I said to her. But through her blubbering, I gathered that it wasn’t my fault.
“What is it, then?” I asked.
“Oh, Josh,” she said. “I am so sorry. But…I think I’m falling in love with him. I’m sorry!”
“In love with Ben?”
“Yes,” she cried. “I’ve had a crush on him for months, yes. But now that we have been fooling around, Josh, I feel different with him, to how I feel with you. I’m so sorry. I feel…in my heart for him, something that I guess I didn’t know was there. But I think that’s what you’re supposed to feel in your heart for someone you fuck. I guess I shouldn’t have married you because I don’t feel that in my heart for you. I am so sorry. Oh God, I am so sorry about this. But it’s been driving me crazy and I’ve just got to be honest and tell you.”
“Tell me what?” I asked.
“I don’t love you, Josh,” she said, through a river of tears. “I’m sorry, I just don’t!”
When I woke up, she was packing a bag.
“What?” I said. “What are you doing?”
“What do you think I’m doing? Did you not hear what I told you last night? Were you drunk?”
“No,” I said. “I heard everything.”
“Then you know, that’s why I’m packing. I don’t love you, Josh. I’ve got to move out.”
“No you don’t,” I said. “That’s the last thing I want.”
“Right. You want to be married to someone who doesn’t love you? How fucked up is that?”
“Well, you might think it’s fucked up,” I said. “But Lexy, you know…it’s perfect for me. In so many ways. I mean, you know my upbringing…you know what I’m used to. My family didn’t love me. They didn’t even want me. So this is exactly what I’m comfortable with. I am just glad that it’s finally out in the open. I mean, you don’t think I knew that you didn’t love me? I mean, on our wedding day you were practically making out with Srivanda out on the balcony. I saw that, you know? The reason I picked you, unconsciously or consciously, must be because I have never felt loved and I wanted to continue that with my adult family.”
“So you want to stay with me, even though I don’t love you?”
She looked at me in disbelief.
“Yes,” I cried. “I love you more than ever now. This is what I want. Unrequited love. I want to suffer. I love it.”
“You love it.”
“Oh my God, if I could somehow let you experience what I experienced last night when you confessed this all to me. If you had been able to feel my chest, the compressions there. It was so intense. And then the back of my throat. It was such a pressure. And in my balls and my cock. I started almost cumming in my pants as you detailed how much you had been faking it, and how you really didn’t love me at all. It was so intense. It was painful and for some reason, the most pleasant feeling I have ever felt. After you went to sleep last night I went to the bathroom and I beat off ten times, I was so horny. Looking at you now, I think I’m going to cum again, just seeing your loveliness, and knowing that you don’t want me — it gives you an unbelievable power, don’t you see. You’ve become…Cleopatra. Royal. Beautiful beyond belief. You’ve become divine. A Goddess I can serve, but never equal. You’ve become…my dream come true.”
She looked at me like I was totally out of my mind.
“Wow, she said. “I did not…expect that.”
She put down her bags.
“So you want me to stay?”
“Yes!” I said. “Please stay.”
“Alright,” she said, looking bewildered. “I’ll stay. For now anyhow.”
And that’s how I became an emotional cuckold. My wife didn’t tell me details about her sex with her boyfriend any more. She shared details about her emotional connection with him. How he made her feel all girlie and excited. She took me shopping when she wanted to buy him a special gift. She wrote me emails and even handwritten letters about what a crush she had on him, how sexy he was, and how wonderful and special a person he was. She drew little hearts. She put her name and his name inside the heart. She took loads of special selfies of the two of them hugging and she sent them all to me. She shared herself and her affair with me totally. Even more than totally. I had the feeling that she was exaggerating a lot of it just because she understood me so perfectly. She knew that the worse she made it for me, the more jealous and shut out I felt, the more excited I got. And she took me there. All the way. She gave me the ultimate thrill. She made me into an emotional cuckold.
My wife. I love her so!I’m walking behind this girl in skintight yoga pants as she leaves the gym, watching her ass shimmy with every step she takes. I’m so mesmerized by the ripple effect that I barely even notice where I’m going. Does my ass jiggle like that when I walk? I can hardly grab it in the street to find out, but it doesn’t feel like it does. Now I’d like to grab her ass and feel her flesh bounce and shake as she sits on my face…
She goes into a coffee shop, and I follow, suddenly seized by a craving for caffeine (and pussy). She sits at a table by the window, catches my eye and smiles invitingly. I’m surprised I don’t recognize her — I thought I knew all the hot girls at my gym — but when I ask if I can join her, the effusive response makes it clear she’s noticed me before.
The morning’s progression is no less enjoyable for being entirely predictable. I’m in my comfort zone here, seducing cute girls being one of my favorite pastimes. Another coffee? Flirtatious chat. Her hand brushes my thigh as she leans across me to reach for the sugar, and she lets it linger there for a moment. Lunch? She lives nearby, she could make us something to eat…
I’ve been looking forward to peeling down those tight yoga pants, but as soon as we get inside her apartment she gives me a quick, promising kiss on the lips, and tells me she wants my opinion on her new outfit. She disappears into the bedroom, leaving me tingling pleasurably with anticipation; and returns a few moments later looking like a walking wet dream. Black lace lingerie, lace-topped stockings, garter belt, high heels; it might be a cliché, but it suits her hourglass figure perfectly. The panties cup her pussy so snugly I can see the hint of a cameltoe, and have a thong back that leaves her magnificent ass cheeks exposed.
Let’s find out what else makes her ass jiggle…
I soon reach the conclusion that those panties look even better around her thighs as I bend her forward over the couch and slot my tongue inside her creamy cunt. She’s so wet I don’t waste any more time with teasing, sucking up her sweetness, licking and rubbing until any hint of nervous inhibition has dissolved under my oral onslaught and she’s moaning and mashing her soaking pussy against my face. I adore feeling a girl shake apart as I eat her out, and I have a feeling I can guess what will push her over the edge.
I pull her panties right down so she can step out of them, then spread her legs — and her cheeks — wider. I was right, she goes wild as I paint her wetness up her ass crack with my tongue, lapping at the tight pucker until I feel her entire body shivering. I press deeper, opening her up little by little. Her legs are quivering, her booty quaking delightfully against my face, and as the tip of my tongue breaches that tight ring of muscle she has one of the fiercest assgasms I’ve ever given a girl, without any significant penetration.
Her legs are too wobbly to support her after that, so I lie back and pull her onto my face, sucking on her clit as I thrust a finger all the way into her ass. It feels almost impossibly tight at first, but a string of mini orgasms courtesy of my lashing tongue makes her loosen up, and then the way she squirms and squeals as I finger-fuck her ass lets me know I’m hitting the spot. But she really goes crazy when I turn her around so she’s sitting her ass on my face in a squat position and grind my knuckles over her clit as I lick her asshole as hard and deep as I can. I’m lucky she doesn’t suffocate me as she sags down on top of me, her body jerking convulsively… although it wouldn’t be a bad way to go, surrounded by twitching girl-flesh.
As first dates go, that was pretty intense. She’s too dazed (and, I suspect, inexperienced in the ways of lady lovin’) to get me off very effectively with her tongue and fingers, so I’m still horny as I go home and make what under the circumstances I can only describe as a “booty call” to my fuck buddy Tony.
I’m stripped down to my G-string, looking at my ass in the full-length mirror in my bedroom, as he answers the phone.
“Tony, does my ass jiggle?” I ask him, in lieu of saying hello. I bounce up and down a bit on the bed, watching for the ripple effect.
“No,” he replies, “your ass is a firm little peach, baby.”
“Not even when I go on the elliptical trainer at the gym?” I ask, vaguely disappointed.
“No. By the way, you know I’m at work, right? Can we not discuss your sexy ass and all the things I’d like to do to it right now, please.”
“Not even when you bend me over and fuck me from behind?”
“No, but it jiggles when I spank it, and you’d better believe you’re going to get a good hard spanking later!” he growls, hanging up.
So now I have my second challenge of the day: can I wait until Tony gets here to spank me until my cheeks are glowing and then fuck me hard enough to make them ripple like jello?
Or…Part ten: Turned on by a sexy plan
When I finished telling Angela’s story I knew I had to go to work, so I swung my legs around my makeup stool to enjoy the sensation of his erection between my breasts for a moment.
‘Does Sue know about you and Angela?’ he asked.
‘Oh yes. I don’t keep anything from her.’ I adjusted my bra so it was more comfortable.
‘Isn’t she jealous?’
‘No… and how could she be, given she is married to Ted?’
The humour was unintentional, but Liam nearly choked all the same. ‘Wait till I tell Toby that!’
‘What about Toby?’
‘You got a problem with me telling him? He is the only person other than Sue — and you — that has never run out on me. I always tell him everything, anyway, he is the only member of my family I have left.’
On day one, Sue and I had agreed that my house would be the one place where Toby could be himself, so I knew him pretty well. ‘No, of course not… anyway, he is such a nice guy.’
Liam looked unsure for a second. ‘Have you ever let him wear your clothes?’
I checked my mascara. There was no point being anything but honest. ‘Yes I have.’ I watched him in the mirror, because I had absolutely no idea what his reaction was going to be.
‘Sue usually lets him do it the moment Ted leaves for work. It felt kinda weird at first, but hey it’s no big deal, apart from when Ted comes home unexpectedly. Man, have we had some narrow escapes.’ He thought for a moment. ‘So, if you let him dress in your clothes, have you ever had… had…’
‘Had sex with him? No. Remember, he is only just eighteen.’ I gave him a stern look. ‘And before you ask, I don’t think Sue has, either.’
‘Just curious. I never know with Sue or you. If either of you did, it would be good for him. He once told me he couldn’t imagine any woman would ever want to have sex with him. Poor guy.’
Liam sounded so completely matter of fact about his brother’s cross dressing and the whole thing seemed so problematic that I let it drop. ‘Hey, I have an idea. Grab your clothes, I want you to come into work and meet someone.’
By the time I pulled the 911 up in my parking space, Liam had done everything except read the manual and take the vehicle to pieces to see how it worked. When we got out, he announced, ‘It’s awesome, but it’s not exactly the kind of car…’ his voice trailed away.
‘…that you expect a woman to own?’ I replied, my eyes glinting.
He recovered himself. ‘Sue says you only got the first one you bought because it was more powerful than Ted’s.’
That was true. I threw a smile over my shoulder. ‘Still remember his little darling face the first time he laid eyes on it.’
‘Why don’t you like him?’
‘Why does everybody not like him? If he wasn’t so certain that he was right and everyone else was wrong, he would be a damn sight easier to get along with.’ I had lost track of how much unsolicited advice Ted had given me over the years — printed out, it would have filled many boring volumes to bursting point.
‘Who am I going to meet?’
I pressed my key fob on the car park exit door. ‘Patience. You will find out soon enough.’
As we rode the elevator I adjusted his shirt. ‘You look great. I would fuck you right here if it wasn’t for the glass walls.’
Liam was still laughing when we reached my office. I threw my bag on a chair and spread my arms. ‘Make yourself at home. Want a coffee?’ When he nodded, I pressed a button on the intercom. ‘Two coffees, one for me and another black with sugar.’
I sank into my chair. This was going to be hugely entertaining, and I could only speculate at the outcome. But outcome there would be — I knew my PA inside out.
When Angela appeared with the coffee, she looked even more cheekily innocent than she normally did, assuming such a thing was possible. She gave Liam a dazzlingly shy smile of greeting, set down our coffees, and then walked very slowly around his chair, enjoying his puzzled appreciation. Men never seem to know how to respond to her, and he was no different — despite wearing a dress that was sensationally short, she managed to radiate her usual air of tomboyish virginity and I could tell he couldn’t cope with it at all. When she was standing right behind him, her coral lips formed the word, ‘Liam?’ and when I returned an imperceptible nod, she mimed sending a text. Then she was gone, leaving a waft of perfume to linger with her memory.
Liam was wide-eyed. ‘Who was that?’ he asked, jumping to his feet as soon as the door closed. He kept staring as if willpower alone could bring her back.
I studied my nails. ‘My PA. Now, drink your coffee, and be a love, I have some work to do.’
My phone went crazy with incoming texts, so many that in the end I excused myself and walked over to Angela’s office.
Her eyes were wide. ‘Is that really Liam?’
I sat on the edge of her desk. ‘Yep.’
She came up very close, spreading my legs so that she could stand between them. ‘I want to see you having sex with him.’
This was the Angela who had me in her palm. ‘You can’t,’ I whispered. ‘You just can’t!’
Her hand slipped inside my knickers and her fingertip went unerringly for its target. ‘You don’t understand. I really really want to see you have sex with him,’ she breathed, slipping two fingers inside as my pussy went to mush.
‘It isn’t possible,’ I hissed. ‘The situation is complicated enough as it is. Besides, you don’t even like having sex with men!’ On the last point I was confident, because in the time she had been with me I had established that Angela was almost exclusively lesbian in her tastes.
Angela didn’t let her eyes drop for a second as she began to work my clit with the ball of her thumb. ‘I don’t want to have sex with him,’ she replied, withdrawing her hand the precise moment before I would have come. ‘But I want to see you do it, and if you show me, then I will do anything you want me to do.’ This despite wearing an expression as if had she had just walked out of teaching Sunday school.
‘Do you want to be in the room with us, or what?’ Her finger was back at work, rubbing my clit through my panties now, and as the two layers of material slid against each other, the feeling began to build until I could hardly think straight. I was gripping the desk and had to force the words out.
‘All I want is to see him in here, filling you, while you squirm and sweat with lust. I know you won’t fail me. I want to see him sink into you until your pussy can take no more of him and then I want you to look at me when he comes.’ She increased her speed until I gasped and came, mostly for thinking of the scene she had just conjured up. Then I knelt while she stood over me and let me service her dripping slit. Her orgasms were quiet, controlled and ladylike, and as soon as they were done, she slipped two fingers deep inside before releasing her knickers. She held them out so I could them clean. ‘Another coffee?’ she asked, with a brilliant smile, for all the world as if she was seeking approval after finishing typing her first business letter.
In the end it turned out to be easier than I could possibly have hoped. After a brief struggle with my conscience, I rationalised that we used video in training all the time at work, so why not for teaching Liam about sex? When we got back home, I changed into a plunge bra and a dress I hadn’t worn in ages and worked the conversation around to the idea.
‘Like we do our own home porno flick?’ He sounded genuinely entertained by the idea. ‘If we do, I promise there won’t be any fast forward stuff.’
I took my courage in my hands and told him I wanted to film it with a proper video camera. To be honest, I could have told him that I wanted to video us having sex on a Swiss roll and he would probably have agreed — now that I had solved his problem he was desperate to make up for lost time.
The practical side of him soon took over. ‘But who is going to film it?’
With as much matter of factness as I could muster, I replied, ‘Angela. She does all our training videos,’ which was true, for I had spent thousands sending her on endless courses on editing and lighting. I just about managed to keep my voice level, because for all her expertise, it wasn’t quite the same as filming a blue movie.
I needn’t have worried. Liam blew out his lips at the thought, and shook his head, as though he couldn’t believe his luck. ‘Is there any chance that she…?’
‘Maybe, but she isn’t really much attracted to men, darling. Besides, I want you to myself for a while.’ I stroked his hair. ‘Angela says we are going to need two or three cameras, to get all the angles, so she will have her work cut out.’
Maybe Sue’s frank accounts of her sexual experiences had paved the way, but to this Liam said no more than, ‘Why not?’ Then, ‘You have already discussed this with her?’
I realised that I had very nearly let the cat out of the bag, so I leaned over, enjoying the thirst in his eyes as he drank in my cleavage. ‘You don’t fancy her more than me, I hope?’ I asked, pressing my upper arms against my boobs to make them pop.
He spluttered, ‘No, certainly not.’
‘But you do fancy her?’
‘Well, yeah, but who wouldn’t? Are you sure she is alright with this?’ He made it sound as if his major worry was that it wouldn’t go ahead. I felt a flood of relief, mixed with the sort of urgent sexual anticipation that only Angela could create in me.
‘Leave me to talk to her, okay? She does whatever I want.’ It was the only white lie of the evening.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.

I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.
Follow MyErotica for refined erotic fiction to ignite your deepest desires.Shallow breaths
As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
HeThe first time, I was pretty sure I was seeing things. I was in my towel, fresh out the shower, ready to pick my undies before heading out for my uni class in town. Deciding what to wear, I had this vague, mostly subconscious sense that my bras and panties weren’t quite laid out how they were the previous morning.
The second time, I was convinced someone had been in my panty drawer. Some of my panties and thongs we definitely not arranged how I’d left them.
I felt pissed. Which of my housemates was going through my personal stuff? There were five of us living together. Two girls, three guys. None of them seemed the sort who’d go through my lingerie. Then again: how would I know?
The third time I caught him. Sat on my bed, with my favorite black lace panties wrapped around his cock. He was pumping himself hard and fast.
“What the fuck, James?” I said angrily, turning on the light.
“Shit,” was all he managed. And then again: “Shit.”
I’ve never seen anyone look so panicked. Deer in the headlights didn’t come close to it.
He took my panties off his cock, left them on my bed, and zipped himself back up. Then, unable to look me in the eyes, he walked straight past me, head down, and up to his top floor bedroom.
Two hours later I was lying in bed, unable to sleep.
The anger had subsided. Bizarrely, the initial feelings of violation had now turned to intrigue.
I’d never thought of any of my housemates as anything but friends. And now suddenly I couldn’t help but think about James differently.
He was into me.
My thoughts lingered for a moment on seeing his cock.
Out of nowhere, I felt a slight shudder of pleasure go through me thinking about my sexiest panties wrapped around it. Without even realizing, my hand had slipped down between my legs.
What was I thinking? I was shocked at myself. I wanted to feel angry again. That was the normal response I should be having. Right? But I couldn’t get the anger back. Suddenly the whole thing felt thrilling.
Before I could stop myself, I picked up my phone. And I texted him.
“Next time, just ask, okay?”
My heart was racing. What was I doing? I felt instant regret.
Then I heard my phone beep.
“Next time?”
Out of nowhere I felt this longing to see his cock again. With my panties wrapped around it. I wanted to watch him do it.
“How about now?” I wrote impulsively.
“?” he replied instantly.
Did I really want to do this? What was I getting myself into?
Fuck it, I thought.
“Come down and play with my panties again…while I watch,” I texted.
My left hand was rubbing my clit through my panties as I typed on the phone with my right. I hadn’t felt turned on like this in ages. Maybe never quite like this.
My phone beeped again.
“Are you serious?”
I found myself getting almost annoyed at his hesitancy, firing off an instant reply.
“Yes! Now get the fuck down here already.”
I heard the floorboards creak. His room was directly above mine. And then his slow footsteps down the stairs. He knocked gently on my door. Walked in, smiling sheepishly.
He didn’t know what to say.
“I want to watch you jerk off in my panties,” I told him, suddenly feeling bold in a way that surprised me.
I lifted the bedcover off and moved so I was sitting on top of it instead. I indicated for him to come and sit next to me. He was still fully dressed and clearly nervous. I found it quite endearing. And it made me want to take charge like I never had before.
“Take your jeans and boxers off,” I told him.
He could hardly look at me, but did it immediately. I smiled when I saw his cock. So big and hard. Maybe he was nervous, but he was as turned on as I was.
“Now take my panties off for me.”
He looked at me, stunned. I could tell he was about to come out with this ‘are you serious’ line again, so I didn’t let him.
“Yes, I’m serious. Take them off. I want you to use these when you jerk off.”
I knelt up. He moved towards me. He slid his hands up the outside of my thighs, under my short nightdress, and up to my black panties. Yes, the ones I’d caught him playing with before.
Feeling his hands on me was mesmerizing. It was tempting to just have sex. But I was determined to watch him play with himself in my panties.
He peeled my panties off me. Instinctively he moved them straight to his face. I totally got off on watching him sniff my panties. I’d never even thought about anything like this and now it was driving my imagination wild.
Then he took my panties and, while looking into my eyes, wrapped them around his oh-so-delicious looking cock.
Instantly he let out a quiet moan as he touched himself for the first time.
I felt so wet that I was sure I was dripping.
I watched him rub himself slowly with my panties. I wasn’t even sure why this was such a turn on. But it was.
I sat on my bed, back to the wall, and parted my legs. I began to play with myself as he sat on the side of my bed rubbing himself harder and faster.
When he turned and saw me, his eyes widened.
“Fuuuucck,” I heard him whisper.
I could tell he was about to come soon.
I was desperate to see him come all over my panties. I don’t even know why. But I wanted it so badly. Needed it.
And then he did.
His body convulsed in front of me. And I watched as he came, covering my panties. I felt myself getting close to my own orgasm now too.
Another thought flashed into my mind.
“Lick my panties,” I told him. “I want to watch you lick your own cum out of my panties.”
James was so turned on he would have done anything.
And he did.
I watched him lick my panties, feeling more aroused than ever in my life.
“Now come and lick me.”
He didn’t hesitate. He lay between my legs, and moved his mouth to my pussy. I grabbed his head, pulling him tight towards me.
It didn’t take long. I was ready. Barely a minute after his tongue moved around my clit, I was ready to explode.
I squirted all over his face.
I’d never squirted before.I expect my Master soon
and knowing His pleasures, I must
prepare myself for His arrival.
I see myself reflected,
corsetted tight and waist nipped in
black, the way He wants me.
I look to check that
seams are straight and too high heels that
thrust my body into provocation.
I scent the room and
light soft candles, making shadows play upon
the body that will be His to use.
I find His ballgag and
part my lips to take it deep, and tighten the strap
so my cheeks bulge with violation.
I ensure His whip is hanging
where He may reach it when need arouses
and mark me in ways He pleases.
I caress the steel of cuffs
between my fingers, wanting to see them
glittering against yielding skin.
I feel compulsion in His iron bed
that will welcome my spread-eagled body
each shackle open with invitation.
I reach down to encircle ankles
to hear the sound of metal closing
moistening me wide for surrender.
I strain above my head to reach the bars
stretched tight is the way He wants me, I must
tighten steel upon my wrists.
I am here for Him now
knowing not when He will come, only that desire
will grow with the waiting.
I can only stare upwards
knowing that when He comes,
I will be only His.
101 Poems for kinky lovers, by Francesca Anderssen is available in paperback and on the Amazon kindle marketplace.Take me as your very own
tie me as your love demands
use me now and use me fully
force me down to your commands
I need to know your chains upon me
such craving there will always be
to want your ropes to hurt my body
so your bonds will set me free
Submission is my total needing
wanting you to make it so
taking me to places strangely
where I cannot help but go
You’re the one who now must hold me
I’ve sold myself to your control
with my freedom gone forever
now that you possess my soul
So tie me tighter yet and tighter
my screams must bite the gag you give
use my mind to make me suffer
this is how I want to live.

Mimi Bordeaux
Nov 7, 2016
Audrey is sitting in a cocktail lounge. She’s sipping her Cosmo, thinking to herself, ‘I deserve a night out. I work hard. It will be nice to enjoy a few drinks.’ She’s happy with her attire and looks elegant. She’s wearing a little black dress with a strand of pearls and her hair is tied up in a French roll.
A plain looking girl enters the bar. She never goes to bars but tonight she’s decided to be adventurous as it’s a warm summer evening. As she walks in she looks around nervously for an empty table. She is thinking, ‘I want to have an encounter… with anyone.’ She has never been in a proper relationship and at 26 she thinks it’s time.
She’s ordering her drink at the bar — a Shirley Temple — when she notices the elegant woman sitting there. Audrey is lost in her own thoughts, but her interest is piqued by Jane’s request for the non-alcoholic drink. She swings her bar stool around to look at her.
Jane summons up the courage to blurt out, “Oh hello… do you come here often?” She feels like a fool for her clichéd opening gambit, but she continues anyway. “I don’t usually go to bars, but here I am.”
Audrey coolly replies, “I like to go out alone and have a few drinks by myself.” She looks Jane up and down, notices that she’s actually rather sweet looking despite her plain clothes, senses her air of barely contained excitement. Her tone becomes warmer. “It’s quite dull here actually. How about you come back to my place and tell me all about yourself?”
“There’s not much to tell,” Jane says nervously, but before she really knows what’s happening she’s agreed to go back to Audrey’s place anyway.
It’s not far by taxi to Audrey’s luxurious apartment. ‘Oh, this is exciting!’ Jane thinks to herself. She still lives with her mother in an ordinary suburban house. Audrey offers her a drink and tells her to make herself comfortable, while she gets changed. She disappears through the double doors leading to her bedroom. Jane looks around; she’s never seen such opulence and she thinks Audrey must be very worldly.
Audrey returns. She has been busy putting on her outfit. She stands there, imposing, looking even taller in fishnet stockings and thigh high leather boots with spike heels. Her black corset barely contains her voluptuous breasts. She is wearing a dog collar around her neck and a black leather mask. She holds a black whip which she flicks every second.
She stares at Jane and says, “Go through that door,” gesturing towards a red leather door off the bedroom with the whip. Jane’s heart is racing. She’s apprehensive but excited by Audrey’s domineering tone. She does as she’s told and enters the room with Audrey following, flicking the whip at her behind. First softly, then a hard crack that stings Jane’s buttocks.
Jane perches on a stool in the middle of the room, the only place to sit, and glances around at her surroundings. Chains, ropes and leather straps hang from the ceiling and walls. She shivers at the sight.
Audrey slams the door shut and barks, “Did I give you permission to sit down?” Jane is confused. Audrey walks toward her, flicking the whip, and stands over her. “Open your legs.” Jane does as she’s told. “Are you getting wet? You must be excited.” Jane squirms, feeling wetness between the tops of her thighs. She’s never felt this way before. There’s a tingling sensation she can’t fathom. It’s because of Audrey.
Jane looks up. Audrey is staring at her and in a second has Jane’s head in her hands. She swipes her tongue up Jane’s cheek then to her mouth, biting hard on the lower lip. She rolls her tongue around Jane’s lips and forcefully enters her mouth, her tongue pushing in deep, grabbing onto Jane’s tongue with her teeth.
Audrey kneels, pulls Jane’s skirt and panties off and moves her head between Jane’s legs. Jane is quivering and needs to hold onto something but there’s nothing except Audrey. She puts her hands on Audrey’s head, winds her fingers into the elegantly coiffured hair. Audrey licks all the way from Jane’s asshole to her clit. She sticks her tongue in Jane’s cunt. In out, in out. She does it over and over again, licking Jane’s whole crack and tongue-fucking her deeper and deeper. Then she focuses on Jane’s clit, licking more softly.
Jane is overwhelmed by the attention and instinctively opens her legs wider. Audrey sucks and nibbles on her swollen clit, licking voraciously. Jane’s head is swimming, she thinks she may faint and her legs are trembling uncontrollably. There’s a fluttering in her stomach like an eel spinning around. She’s sweating, her chest is burning and her face is flushed. She’s on the verge of something, a sensation she’s never felt before. It’s building up from her toes, up her legs; between them she feels a gush of fluid. Suddenly she throws her head back, straining, her eyes tight shut; she grabs Audrey’s head and makes a high-pitched involuntary screech. She can’t think, see or hear any more, but she’s screaming out her pleasure as she slides off the stool.
“Shut up!” Audrey says harshly, pulling her to her feet and leading her by the neck to some ropes hanging from the ceiling. She ties Jane’s hands tightly and tells her to bend over. Jane is giddy, but she does as she’s told. There’s a sound behind her, then she feels something touching her cunt. It thrusts inside her, going right to the hilt, then out again. It goes in again and starts to move slowly, in out, in out. Jane moans as the thrusting becomes more intense.
Now it’s moving more quickly, sending waves of heat up Jane’s body. She moans and whispers, “Yes… oh yes!” as Audrey pumps her cunt with force. Audrey slams the dildo in, pressing at a special spot that has Jane intoxicated. Jane can’t hold back any longer and yells out, clutching at the rope, sweat dripping from her forehead, her cunt soaking wet and squirting juices that dribble down her thighs.
Audrey turns Jane around and thrusts the dildo into her mouth, making her gag for a moment before she adjusts to its size. “Suck!” says Audrey sternly. The dildo is coated with cum and Jane tastes her own juice for the first time.
Audrey unties Jane’s wrists and buckles a dog collar around her neck, with a short leash attached. She leads her to a wooden table. “Bend over and put your ass in the air, slut,” she commands her. The words have an instant effect on Jane, who feels her cunt swell and throb, more wetness trickling down her thighs. She’s so turned on.
Audrey holds onto the leash and rubs her finger against Jane’s asshole. Jane feels something cold and sticky being spread over her, and then Audrey’s fingertip wriggling into her ass. It feels strange, but good. The finger goes a little deeper, and then suddenly thrusts all the way inside. She yells.
“Shut up, slut,” Audrey says, adding a second finger and pumping them in and out of Jane’s ass. Jane lies flat against the table, ass up, and takes it. She starts to like it. She moans with each stroke.
“You like that do you, my little slut?” Audrey says, going deeper and faster. Jane is dizzy with excitement, growling and howling. Her orgasm fires through her whole body, radiating out from her core.
After a few minutes Audrey withdraws her fingers and Jane slumps down onto the table, exhausted. Audrey grabs the leash, making Jane stand, then removes the collar. She stares at Jane. She grabs her head and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck, then kisses her on the mouth.
“Time for you to go home,” she says. “You know the way out.” She marches Jane to the red door and pushes her through it, throwing her clothes after her. Jane dresses rapidly and staggers to the front door. Her pussy and ass are throbbing as she runs down the stairs. She’s floating. She feels like a bird in flight. She begins to walk.This girl looks exactly like me. The same long, wavy blonde hair. The same blue-grey eyes, the sprinkling of freckles over the bridge of her nose. The same slender fingers, moving to my nipple, as mine move to hers. We could be twins.
Only the tattoo on my back and the one on her foot mark us apart. She laughs when she undresses me and sees mine.
“Maybe I need to get one like it,” she says, getting down on her knees to kiss it, lick it; her tongue moving lower, down the cleft of my ass.
We met earlier that night, in a bar.
Coming face to face, I think for a moment that I’m walking into a mirror. We stare at each other for a long while, fascinated.
Before long we’ve both ditched our dates and are huddled in a corner, insulated from the noise of the bar by our absorption in each other. We’re drunk on the sight of each other, cataloguing the myriad points on which we are the same and the few tiny differences, obsessively.
“You’re just like me,” we keep telling each other.
When she asks my name and I say, ‘Narcisse,’ she laughs delightedly, getting the reference at once: Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection and died for love of himself.
She tells me hers is ‘Belle,’ which I know means beautiful; I’m not sure whether or not she’s lying but I like the inference, so I call her Belle anyway.
A little later and we’re sitting so close she’s practically on my lap, kissing avidly.
“Bet you’d fuck yourself if you could, wouldn’t you?” she says.
“Of course I would. Wouldn’t you?” She nods, unabashed. “Want to find out what it feels like?”
She nods again, runs a fingertip up my thigh as she leans in to whisper, “Your place or mine?”
My place then, the bedroom lights blazing so we can see every minute detail of each other as we undress, touch, explore. Every inch of her body looks strangely familiar. I lick each smooth expanse of skin as I uncover it, mapping the territory as I go, noting each hair and freckle. She shivers with arousal as I kiss her neck and then on downward, cupping a breast and sucking the nipple; she moans and I feel it harden against my tongue. Her responsiveness pleases me and my own nipples stiffen in sympathy, as if what I’m doing to her is physically mirrored in my own trembling flesh. I suck harder, my hands encircling her waist and running down over her hips.
I kiss and lick my way down her taut stomach, feeling it ripple at my light touch, then slide her panties down to her thighs and gaze at her pussy, enthralled. A neat tuft of blonde curls crowns her smooth, plump-lipped cunt. It’s like looking at myself from an angle I’ve never experienced before. I stare and stare until the intensity makes her fidget and she breaks the spell by pulling me onto the bed, breathless and flushed.
“What do you like?” she asks; meaning: how shall I get you off?
“You know what I like,” I reply, meaning: we’re the same. I like what you like.
Turns out I’m both right and wrong. She starts out gentle and teasing, kissing and licking around the edge of my skimpy panties, sucking my inner thigh, then licking me through the thin fabric until I’m dripping. By the time she peels my panties off and skims a fingertip along the slippery groove between my lips, I’m fighting the urge to tell her faster, harder, fuck me now! But it seems the teasing is what I wanted after all. Her touch is insistent, hypnotic, a slow build to a long drawn-out orgasm that has me screaming when she finally lets me come with three fingers plunging into my drenched hole and her lips suctioned around my clit.
I roll her onto her back and straddle her, kissing her insatiably, licking my cream from her lips. Pulling back to look into her eyes, I’m giddy with lust. For one vertiginous moment I feel as if I’m falling into a mirror, fucking myself into insanity.
Now all I can think about is tasting her. I spin around into a sixty-nine so I can hover my pussy over her face, too sensitive from my orgasm for much contact but shivering with arousal as she flicks her tongue delicately over my folds. My approach is more direct, more brutal; she’s shown me how she likes to be touched and now I’m teaching her my way. Spreading her open with my fingers, I swipe my tongue across her clit, over and over, relentless. My elbows pin her knees apart, my weight pinioning her so however much she squirms, she can’t escape the overpowering sensations. When she’s moaning and babbling deliriously, her hips juddering as she tries to hump up against my tongue, I thrust two fingers from each hand inside her, stretching her open and curling them to seek out her G-spot. Her hips buck so hard she nearly throws me off her as she comes, soaking my hands. She tastes just like me and that thought, coupled with the way she sucks fiercely at my cunt as she loses it, makes me come again.
We lie facing each other, and gaze into each other’s eyes, absorbing this information, the new things we’ve learned about ourselves from each other.
“I never knew I could come like that,” she says, wonderingly.
“I never knew I liked to be teased so much,” I laugh. She reaches for me again, kissing me hard as she slides one leg between my thighs, hooking the other over my hip. A little shuffling and we’re grinding together, pussy to pussy, both so hot and wet. There’s just enough friction to drive me out of my mind, my clit throbbing as I rub against her, hips moving in tight circles. This time, coming feels like hurtling down a long, dark tunnel into an explosion of light. I don’t know if the hammering against my chest is her heart or mine. The sense of consummation is profound.
We’ve been kissing and fingering, licking and sucking and fucking each other for so many hours it’s daylight when we finally disengage, blissed out and exhausted.
“Can I see you again,” she asks.
“You’ll see me every time you look in the mirror,” I reply.Watching your wife get fucked by another man is a real thrill, there is no doubt about that. But there are some cucks who want to take it even further. How can you go further than fucking? Cucks like me, we don’t just want our wives to cheat on us with their bodies. What we long for, more than anything else, is for our wives to develop real feelings for the bull.
It is called emotional cuckoldry. And it is not for the faint of heart. It is for people who are willing to really test their own inner strength. Maybe you suspect that it would be nice to watch your wife falling for another. I mean, it brings the excitement of competition to the surface, after all. But then, your heart gets kind of stamped on as she reveals to you the truth — that not only does he have a bigger cock than you, but he has also managed to awaken a real heart connection in her. Yes, that’s exciting too. But it is also incredibly scary. It means she might leave you.
And this is the real juice.
We emotional cuckolds must have had some abandonment issues in the past. And this fear of abandonment somehow is fused in our psyche with eroticism. So when the idea that our wife might leave first presents itself, the lump we feel in our throat is like nothing else. It unearths a desire and an excitement in us that is reckless — almost unlawful. Certainly taboo. We are not supposed to enjoy this. We must be masochistic, though, because we do. It hurts so good. So good.
It first happened to me with Ben, a guy that my wife had started fooling around with at work.
I knew she had a crush on him, that much she had confessed to me. But she hadn’t told me any of the details. I had assured her it was OK for her to pursue this crush, but she didn’t trust me, I guess. But finally, we had a date night, planned a week in advance, and I was able to get some of the details out of her.
It was dinner at The Corner Place, our favorite casual but awesome Italian. I waited until we had both ordered and had sipped a little red wine. Then I hit her with it.
“So, Lexy,” I said. “I’ve known you for a long time. You know, three years before we even started dating. Three years of dating. One year of marriage. That’s seven years.”
“Uh huh. Good math skills.”
She’s funny, I’ll give her that.
“I know you honey,” I said. “You can’t, you know…”
“I can’t what?”
“Well, I know you. And I would know if you weren’t, you know, telling me everything…”
“Oh, can we not talk about Ben tonight,” she said. “Can we just have a date night, me and you. Without Ben.”
“Of course.”
Shut down.
She shut me right down. Now I had to sit with these feelings. She was totally cheating on me. I mean, I knew she was cheating on me. But even this, being totally cheated on by the person who was cheating on me, by her withholding the details. Even this, I loved it.
It was a tortuous but lovely feeling.
We got through the whole date night. Got in bed, and I started making love to her. And as I was going down on her, I said, “Mmm, this tastes so good.” And then I just coyly asked her, “Has Ben tasted how good this tastes?”
“Mmmhmmm,” she murmured.
“I’m sorry,” I said, between licks of her clit. “Was that a yes?”
“Mmmmhmm,” she said.
“When did the lucky boy taste that?” I said, coming up for air.
“A couple days ago,” she gasped; she was almost ready to climax now. “We went back to his apartment at lunch. He wanted to fuck me. But I couldn’t.”
“So he just ate you,” I said.
“Mmmhmmm.”
“Did you cum?”
“Mmmhmmm.”
“And…”
“Oh shut up, I’m going to cum!”
And I concentrated on my work and made her cum real well. Then she went down and started reciprocating on my cock.
“Ah, and has Ben been as lucky as me in this regard?” I asked.
“Oh Jesus,” she said. “I’m trying to suck a dick here. Are you going to interrogate me or do you want a blow job?”
“Just nod or shake your head. Have you sucked his dick?”
She nodded.
I felt so good then. We were complete again. We weren’t holding anything back.
“Was it a nice dick?”
She shrugged her shoulders, then she nodded. I guessed it was a pretty nice dick.
“Bigger or smaller than mine?”
She made a kind of sing-songy noise. I didn’t hear it at first. But when she repeated it, I took her to be sing-songing “a little bigger.”
“A little bigger?”
She nodded.
“That’s good. That’s very good.”
It was so good in fact that I shot my load right then.
She was pissed.
“Josh!” she said. “I wanted to get fucked! I really wanted you to fuck me on our date night. Damn it.”
She got in bed next to me. But she wasn’t the one who should be pissed. It was her fault. She’d never told me this. And then, to find it out this way, through my subterfuge, it was all so exciting, I couldn’t help myself when I finally saw her nodding and admitting to a blow job. I just came like crazy.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” I said, finally asking the question that had been hanging between us.
“I’m sorry honey,” she said. “I just…I just didn’t feel like…you know, going through the details…I wanted it to be something…private, between me and Ben. Just this one private thing. I mean, I think that’s all it’s ever going to be. I don’t think I can bring myself to fuck him. So he ate my pussy and he made me cum and I sucked his cock and I made him cum, but–”
“Did he cum in your mouth?”
“See,” she said.
“See what?”
“This! I mean, I thought we could do this, Josh. I thought you could be…cooler about it. But maybe you can’t…handle it, I don’t know. I am going to call the whole thing off.”
“No! I can handle it!” I panicked. I was anxious that she was going to call the whole thing off. That was the last thing I wanted. “I don’t want you to call it off.”
It was then that she just broke down crying like crazy. I thought it was all my fault.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” I said to her. But through her blubbering, I gathered that it wasn’t my fault.
“What is it, then?” I asked.
“Oh, Josh,” she said. “I am so sorry. But…I think I’m falling in love with him. I’m sorry!”
“In love with Ben?”
“Yes,” she cried. “I’ve had a crush on him for months, yes. But now that we have been fooling around, Josh, I feel different with him, to how I feel with you. I’m so sorry. I feel…in my heart for him, something that I guess I didn’t know was there. But I think that’s what you’re supposed to feel in your heart for someone you fuck. I guess I shouldn’t have married you because I don’t feel that in my heart for you. I am so sorry. Oh God, I am so sorry about this. But it’s been driving me crazy and I’ve just got to be honest and tell you.”
“Tell me what?” I asked.
“I don’t love you, Josh,” she said, through a river of tears. “I’m sorry, I just don’t!”
When I woke up, she was packing a bag.
“What?” I said. “What are you doing?”
“What do you think I’m doing? Did you not hear what I told you last night? Were you drunk?”
“No,” I said. “I heard everything.”
“Then you know, that’s why I’m packing. I don’t love you, Josh. I’ve got to move out.”
“No you don’t,” I said. “That’s the last thing I want.”
“Right. You want to be married to someone who doesn’t love you? How fucked up is that?”
“Well, you might think it’s fucked up,” I said. “But Lexy, you know…it’s perfect for me. In so many ways. I mean, you know my upbringing…you know what I’m used to. My family didn’t love me. They didn’t even want me. So this is exactly what I’m comfortable with. I am just glad that it’s finally out in the open. I mean, you don’t think I knew that you didn’t love me? I mean, on our wedding day you were practically making out with Srivanda out on the balcony. I saw that, you know? The reason I picked you, unconsciously or consciously, must be because I have never felt loved and I wanted to continue that with my adult family.”
“So you want to stay with me, even though I don’t love you?”
She looked at me in disbelief.
“Yes,” I cried. “I love you more than ever now. This is what I want. Unrequited love. I want to suffer. I love it.”
“You love it.”
“Oh my God, if I could somehow let you experience what I experienced last night when you confessed this all to me. If you had been able to feel my chest, the compressions there. It was so intense. And then the back of my throat. It was such a pressure. And in my balls and my cock. I started almost cumming in my pants as you detailed how much you had been faking it, and how you really didn’t love me at all. It was so intense. It was painful and for some reason, the most pleasant feeling I have ever felt. After you went to sleep last night I went to the bathroom and I beat off ten times, I was so horny. Looking at you now, I think I’m going to cum again, just seeing your loveliness, and knowing that you don’t want me — it gives you an unbelievable power, don’t you see. You’ve become…Cleopatra. Royal. Beautiful beyond belief. You’ve become divine. A Goddess I can serve, but never equal. You’ve become…my dream come true.”
She looked at me like I was totally out of my mind.
“Wow, she said. “I did not…expect that.”
She put down her bags.
“So you want me to stay?”
“Yes!” I said. “Please stay.”
“Alright,” she said, looking bewildered. “I’ll stay. For now anyhow.”
And that’s how I became an emotional cuckold. My wife didn’t tell me details about her sex with her boyfriend any more. She shared details about her emotional connection with him. How he made her feel all girlie and excited. She took me shopping when she wanted to buy him a special gift. She wrote me emails and even handwritten letters about what a crush she had on him, how sexy he was, and how wonderful and special a person he was. She drew little hearts. She put her name and his name inside the heart. She took loads of special selfies of the two of them hugging and she sent them all to me. She shared herself and her affair with me totally. Even more than totally. I had the feeling that she was exaggerating a lot of it just because she understood me so perfectly. She knew that the worse she made it for me, the more jealous and shut out I felt, the more excited I got. And she took me there. All the way. She gave me the ultimate thrill. She made me into an emotional cuckold.
My wife. I love her so!I’m walking behind this girl in skintight yoga pants as she leaves the gym, watching her ass shimmy with every step she takes. I’m so mesmerized by the ripple effect that I barely even notice where I’m going. Does my ass jiggle like that when I walk? I can hardly grab it in the street to find out, but it doesn’t feel like it does. Now I’d like to grab her ass and feel her flesh bounce and shake as she sits on my face…
She goes into a coffee shop, and I follow, suddenly seized by a craving for caffeine (and pussy). She sits at a table by the window, catches my eye and smiles invitingly. I’m surprised I don’t recognize her — I thought I knew all the hot girls at my gym — but when I ask if I can join her, the effusive response makes it clear she’s noticed me before.
The morning’s progression is no less enjoyable for being entirely predictable. I’m in my comfort zone here, seducing cute girls being one of my favorite pastimes. Another coffee? Flirtatious chat. Her hand brushes my thigh as she leans across me to reach for the sugar, and she lets it linger there for a moment. Lunch? She lives nearby, she could make us something to eat…
I’ve been looking forward to peeling down those tight yoga pants, but as soon as we get inside her apartment she gives me a quick, promising kiss on the lips, and tells me she wants my opinion on her new outfit. She disappears into the bedroom, leaving me tingling pleasurably with anticipation; and returns a few moments later looking like a walking wet dream. Black lace lingerie, lace-topped stockings, garter belt, high heels; it might be a cliché, but it suits her hourglass figure perfectly. The panties cup her pussy so snugly I can see the hint of a cameltoe, and have a thong back that leaves her magnificent ass cheeks exposed.
Let’s find out what else makes her ass jiggle…
I soon reach the conclusion that those panties look even better around her thighs as I bend her forward over the couch and slot my tongue inside her creamy cunt. She’s so wet I don’t waste any more time with teasing, sucking up her sweetness, licking and rubbing until any hint of nervous inhibition has dissolved under my oral onslaught and she’s moaning and mashing her soaking pussy against my face. I adore feeling a girl shake apart as I eat her out, and I have a feeling I can guess what will push her over the edge.
I pull her panties right down so she can step out of them, then spread her legs — and her cheeks — wider. I was right, she goes wild as I paint her wetness up her ass crack with my tongue, lapping at the tight pucker until I feel her entire body shivering. I press deeper, opening her up little by little. Her legs are quivering, her booty quaking delightfully against my face, and as the tip of my tongue breaches that tight ring of muscle she has one of the fiercest assgasms I’ve ever given a girl, without any significant penetration.
Her legs are too wobbly to support her after that, so I lie back and pull her onto my face, sucking on her clit as I thrust a finger all the way into her ass. It feels almost impossibly tight at first, but a string of mini orgasms courtesy of my lashing tongue makes her loosen up, and then the way she squirms and squeals as I finger-fuck her ass lets me know I’m hitting the spot. But she really goes crazy when I turn her around so she’s sitting her ass on my face in a squat position and grind my knuckles over her clit as I lick her asshole as hard and deep as I can. I’m lucky she doesn’t suffocate me as she sags down on top of me, her body jerking convulsively… although it wouldn’t be a bad way to go, surrounded by twitching girl-flesh.
As first dates go, that was pretty intense. She’s too dazed (and, I suspect, inexperienced in the ways of lady lovin’) to get me off very effectively with her tongue and fingers, so I’m still horny as I go home and make what under the circumstances I can only describe as a “booty call” to my fuck buddy Tony.
I’m stripped down to my G-string, looking at my ass in the full-length mirror in my bedroom, as he answers the phone.
“Tony, does my ass jiggle?” I ask him, in lieu of saying hello. I bounce up and down a bit on the bed, watching for the ripple effect.
“No,” he replies, “your ass is a firm little peach, baby.”
“Not even when I go on the elliptical trainer at the gym?” I ask, vaguely disappointed.
“No. By the way, you know I’m at work, right? Can we not discuss your sexy ass and all the things I’d like to do to it right now, please.”
“Not even when you bend me over and fuck me from behind?”
“No, but it jiggles when I spank it, and you’d better believe you’re going to get a good hard spanking later!” he growls, hanging up.
So now I have my second challenge of the day: can I wait until Tony gets here to spank me until my cheeks are glowing and then fuck me hard enough to make them ripple like jello?
Or…Part ten: Turned on by a sexy plan
When I finished telling Angela’s story I knew I had to go to work, so I swung my legs around my makeup stool to enjoy the sensation of his erection between my breasts for a moment.
‘Does Sue know about you and Angela?’ he asked.
‘Oh yes. I don’t keep anything from her.’ I adjusted my bra so it was more comfortable.
‘Isn’t she jealous?’
‘No… and how could she be, given she is married to Ted?’
The humour was unintentional, but Liam nearly choked all the same. ‘Wait till I tell Toby that!’
‘What about Toby?’
‘You got a problem with me telling him? He is the only person other than Sue — and you — that has never run out on me. I always tell him everything, anyway, he is the only member of my family I have left.’
On day one, Sue and I had agreed that my house would be the one place where Toby could be himself, so I knew him pretty well. ‘No, of course not… anyway, he is such a nice guy.’
Liam looked unsure for a second. ‘Have you ever let him wear your clothes?’
I checked my mascara. There was no point being anything but honest. ‘Yes I have.’ I watched him in the mirror, because I had absolutely no idea what his reaction was going to be.
‘Sue usually lets him do it the moment Ted leaves for work. It felt kinda weird at first, but hey it’s no big deal, apart from when Ted comes home unexpectedly. Man, have we had some narrow escapes.’ He thought for a moment. ‘So, if you let him dress in your clothes, have you ever had… had…’
‘Had sex with him? No. Remember, he is only just eighteen.’ I gave him a stern look. ‘And before you ask, I don’t think Sue has, either.’
‘Just curious. I never know with Sue or you. If either of you did, it would be good for him. He once told me he couldn’t imagine any woman would ever want to have sex with him. Poor guy.’
Liam sounded so completely matter of fact about his brother’s cross dressing and the whole thing seemed so problematic that I let it drop. ‘Hey, I have an idea. Grab your clothes, I want you to come into work and meet someone.’
By the time I pulled the 911 up in my parking space, Liam had done everything except read the manual and take the vehicle to pieces to see how it worked. When we got out, he announced, ‘It’s awesome, but it’s not exactly the kind of car…’ his voice trailed away.
‘…that you expect a woman to own?’ I replied, my eyes glinting.
He recovered himself. ‘Sue says you only got the first one you bought because it was more powerful than Ted’s.’
That was true. I threw a smile over my shoulder. ‘Still remember his little darling face the first time he laid eyes on it.’
‘Why don’t you like him?’
‘Why does everybody not like him? If he wasn’t so certain that he was right and everyone else was wrong, he would be a damn sight easier to get along with.’ I had lost track of how much unsolicited advice Ted had given me over the years — printed out, it would have filled many boring volumes to bursting point.
‘Who am I going to meet?’
I pressed my key fob on the car park exit door. ‘Patience. You will find out soon enough.’
As we rode the elevator I adjusted his shirt. ‘You look great. I would fuck you right here if it wasn’t for the glass walls.’
Liam was still laughing when we reached my office. I threw my bag on a chair and spread my arms. ‘Make yourself at home. Want a coffee?’ When he nodded, I pressed a button on the intercom. ‘Two coffees, one for me and another black with sugar.’
I sank into my chair. This was going to be hugely entertaining, and I could only speculate at the outcome. But outcome there would be — I knew my PA inside out.
When Angela appeared with the coffee, she looked even more cheekily innocent than she normally did, assuming such a thing was possible. She gave Liam a dazzlingly shy smile of greeting, set down our coffees, and then walked very slowly around his chair, enjoying his puzzled appreciation. Men never seem to know how to respond to her, and he was no different — despite wearing a dress that was sensationally short, she managed to radiate her usual air of tomboyish virginity and I could tell he couldn’t cope with it at all. When she was standing right behind him, her coral lips formed the word, ‘Liam?’ and when I returned an imperceptible nod, she mimed sending a text. Then she was gone, leaving a waft of perfume to linger with her memory.
Liam was wide-eyed. ‘Who was that?’ he asked, jumping to his feet as soon as the door closed. He kept staring as if willpower alone could bring her back.
I studied my nails. ‘My PA. Now, drink your coffee, and be a love, I have some work to do.’
My phone went crazy with incoming texts, so many that in the end I excused myself and walked over to Angela’s office.
Her eyes were wide. ‘Is that really Liam?’
I sat on the edge of her desk. ‘Yep.’
She came up very close, spreading my legs so that she could stand between them. ‘I want to see you having sex with him.’
This was the Angela who had me in her palm. ‘You can’t,’ I whispered. ‘You just can’t!’
Her hand slipped inside my knickers and her fingertip went unerringly for its target. ‘You don’t understand. I really really want to see you have sex with him,’ she breathed, slipping two fingers inside as my pussy went to mush.
‘It isn’t possible,’ I hissed. ‘The situation is complicated enough as it is. Besides, you don’t even like having sex with men!’ On the last point I was confident, because in the time she had been with me I had established that Angela was almost exclusively lesbian in her tastes.
Angela didn’t let her eyes drop for a second as she began to work my clit with the ball of her thumb. ‘I don’t want to have sex with him,’ she replied, withdrawing her hand the precise moment before I would have come. ‘But I want to see you do it, and if you show me, then I will do anything you want me to do.’ This despite wearing an expression as if had she had just walked out of teaching Sunday school.
‘Do you want to be in the room with us, or what?’ Her finger was back at work, rubbing my clit through my panties now, and as the two layers of material slid against each other, the feeling began to build until I could hardly think straight. I was gripping the desk and had to force the words out.
‘All I want is to see him in here, filling you, while you squirm and sweat with lust. I know you won’t fail me. I want to see him sink into you until your pussy can take no more of him and then I want you to look at me when he comes.’ She increased her speed until I gasped and came, mostly for thinking of the scene she had just conjured up. Then I knelt while she stood over me and let me service her dripping slit. Her orgasms were quiet, controlled and ladylike, and as soon as they were done, she slipped two fingers deep inside before releasing her knickers. She held them out so I could them clean. ‘Another coffee?’ she asked, with a brilliant smile, for all the world as if she was seeking approval after finishing typing her first business letter.
In the end it turned out to be easier than I could possibly have hoped. After a brief struggle with my conscience, I rationalised that we used video in training all the time at work, so why not for teaching Liam about sex? When we got back home, I changed into a plunge bra and a dress I hadn’t worn in ages and worked the conversation around to the idea.
‘Like we do our own home porno flick?’ He sounded genuinely entertained by the idea. ‘If we do, I promise there won’t be any fast forward stuff.’
I took my courage in my hands and told him I wanted to film it with a proper video camera. To be honest, I could have told him that I wanted to video us having sex on a Swiss roll and he would probably have agreed — now that I had solved his problem he was desperate to make up for lost time.
The practical side of him soon took over. ‘But who is going to film it?’
With as much matter of factness as I could muster, I replied, ‘Angela. She does all our training videos,’ which was true, for I had spent thousands sending her on endless courses on editing and lighting. I just about managed to keep my voice level, because for all her expertise, it wasn’t quite the same as filming a blue movie.
I needn’t have worried. Liam blew out his lips at the thought, and shook his head, as though he couldn’t believe his luck. ‘Is there any chance that she…?’
‘Maybe, but she isn’t really much attracted to men, darling. Besides, I want you to myself for a while.’ I stroked his hair. ‘Angela says we are going to need two or three cameras, to get all the angles, so she will have her work cut out.’
Maybe Sue’s frank accounts of her sexual experiences had paved the way, but to this Liam said no more than, ‘Why not?’ Then, ‘You have already discussed this with her?’
I realised that I had very nearly let the cat out of the bag, so I leaned over, enjoying the thirst in his eyes as he drank in my cleavage. ‘You don’t fancy her more than me, I hope?’ I asked, pressing my upper arms against my boobs to make them pop.
He spluttered, ‘No, certainly not.’
‘But you do fancy her?’
‘Well, yeah, but who wouldn’t? Are you sure she is alright with this?’ He made it sound as if his major worry was that it wouldn’t go ahead. I felt a flood of relief, mixed with the sort of urgent sexual anticipation that only Angela could create in me.
‘Leave me to talk to her, okay? She does whatever I want.’ It was the only white lie of the evening.As they walked in the room he handed her an envelope. They were coming back from dinner at a posh place in the rooftop of one of the tallest buildings in London. She looked radiant in her little black dress and high heels. It was a celebration of sorts, and the night was still young.
He had flown in early in the afternoon and as soon as they had checked into the room they were fucking like bunnies. Going for dinner had been a necessary break to gather energy and fresh air for the encore session they were about to start. She looked in his mischievous eyes and asked:
“What’s in the envelope?”
He explained that he had written a bunch of positions on a set of cards and she could use them to choose the next position in which she wanted to be shagged. He was always having these unorthodox ideas, and now she was curious. She opened it up and found a familiar set of positions written down:
Missionary on the sofa
Monkey in the bathroom sink
Doggy standing by the mirror
Flat on the belly
…
One card caught her attention. She held it in her hand and looked up at his dark chocolatey eyes:
“What is upside down spoons?”
He answered that he would be happy to show her, as a naughty smile flashed across his face. She loved that look in his eyes, and felt her inner works jump with emotion. It made her feel so wanted, and gave her goosebumps. He helped her off with her coat, and then her shoes.
He had actually helped dress her up before dinner. He liked doing that, and she knew it was a strange kink but she liked it. As she had been lying naked in bed he had gathered the clothes she had brought for the occasion. He had gotten her garter belt on first, then her black stockings. He had then wrapped her up in her short black dress, no bra. And had finished by pulling her panties up.
She liked it when he did that to her. It was a special feeling of being cared for, even if it meant that she had to help with the stockings and correct her dress as she was getting her make up done in the bathroom.
As they were walking to the restaurant she felt some of their mixed juices dripping from her. During dinner it was a constant reminder of their hard workout that afternoon.
They started kissing. Soft in the lips. Her hands busy unbuttoning his shirt. His hands pulling up her dress. She was enjoying the feeling of his warm touch on her. And his hurry to get his hands under her clothes to caress her bare skin. He pulled the zipper of her dress down and helped her out of it, as she opened his shirt and got her hands on his chest.
They also liked undressing each other. It felt as if they were unwrapping their presents. She put her hands up to help him get her out of her dress. As he pushed her dress above her boobs, she started caressing him with soft touches of her fingernails.
She fell back onto the bed as he started kissing her right nipple. She loved the way he circled its tip with his tongue, making it wet and slurping on it until it felt as if her whole boob was made out of stone. As he moved to her other breast she could also feel how he was getting rid of his shirt and trousers.
She liked to lie in bed and have him do things to her. She had told him before how she enjoyed giving up control to him. After he got her second nipple wet and hard he started cruising her body with his mouth. Discovering every inch of her, kiss by kiss. As he got to the bottom of her rib cage she felt how he was sucking harder on her. He was marking the path through her using hickeys instead of breadcrumbs.
She was still lying in bed with her hands up and her dress covering her face. In a way as if she were blindfolded, except that she could free herself at any time. She felt him going down past her belly button and proceeding to her panties.
Her panties were wet, as in extra wet. He removed them and started exploring her vulva with his mouth. He found a little concentrate of their juices at her entrance. It almost felt like candy. He got as much as he could on the tip of his tongue and moved up to kiss her. He had to move the dress above her head to place the sweet dessert he had found on her mouth. She giggled when she realized what it was. As he was freeing her from her dress she asked him:
“So what about that upside down spoons you wrote about?”
He winked at her and moved her onto her side, as if he was going to spoon her from behind. Except that he placed his head at her feet and his knees on her back. He was indeed upside down from her. He opened up one of her legs as she reached for his shaft. It only took a few strokes to have him ready to go in. She placed the tip at her entrance and he moved up her hips to place himself in position.
The visuals were fantastic. She was so wet that he slid all the way in at the first push. He was kissing her left leg and holding her by her waist. She liked seeing how his cock was moving in and out of her. He told her with a wicked smile:
“ Remember how I told you I wanted to see how you masturbate? Well, now is the time. Show me how you touch yourself when we are not together and you are missing me!”
He got her hand on top of her clit and she started her little number, with two fingertips going up and down on top of it. He was moving slowly in and out, as she reached to his shaft to get some of their juices on her fingertips. Her fingers continued the dancing routine, except that the intimate atmosphere had now been replaced by the voyeurism of feeling his stare on her.
This felt so extremely hot to him. He could see in her face what she was experiencing. Every now and then she flashed a smile at him and looked in his eyes. She still had her stockings and garter belt on, and the view of her fantastic body from his vantage point was something out of this world. He could see in her expression how she was concentrating on her orgasm.
Her fingers were doing the final strokes and she knew she would be over the edge soon. The slow in and out dance was helping her build up. She opened her mouth to tell him:
“I am about to come…”
And with a few more caresses she arched her back and released the next batch of energy. He parked his cock all the way inside of her and could feel her shaking surrounding him. He was looking at her, as a spectator who has been given access to a very private show. A show built up of their love, of their want of each other, and from the build up of the days that they had not been together.
They agreed that these are the moments worth living for.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.

I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.
Follow MyErotica for refined erotic fiction to ignite your deepest desires.Shallow breaths
As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
HeThe first time, I was pretty sure I was seeing things. I was in my towel, fresh out the shower, ready to pick my undies before heading out for my uni class in town. Deciding what to wear, I had this vague, mostly subconscious sense that my bras and panties weren’t quite laid out how they were the previous morning.
The second time, I was convinced someone had been in my panty drawer. Some of my panties and thongs we definitely not arranged how I’d left them.
I felt pissed. Which of my housemates was going through my personal stuff? There were five of us living together. Two girls, three guys. None of them seemed the sort who’d go through my lingerie. Then again: how would I know?
The third time I caught him. Sat on my bed, with my favorite black lace panties wrapped around his cock. He was pumping himself hard and fast.
“What the fuck, James?” I said angrily, turning on the light.
“Shit,” was all he managed. And then again: “Shit.”
I’ve never seen anyone look so panicked. Deer in the headlights didn’t come close to it.
He took my panties off his cock, left them on my bed, and zipped himself back up. Then, unable to look me in the eyes, he walked straight past me, head down, and up to his top floor bedroom.
Two hours later I was lying in bed, unable to sleep.
The anger had subsided. Bizarrely, the initial feelings of violation had now turned to intrigue.
I’d never thought of any of my housemates as anything but friends. And now suddenly I couldn’t help but think about James differently.
He was into me.
My thoughts lingered for a moment on seeing his cock.
Out of nowhere, I felt a slight shudder of pleasure go through me thinking about my sexiest panties wrapped around it. Without even realizing, my hand had slipped down between my legs.
What was I thinking? I was shocked at myself. I wanted to feel angry again. That was the normal response I should be having. Right? But I couldn’t get the anger back. Suddenly the whole thing felt thrilling.
Before I could stop myself, I picked up my phone. And I texted him.
“Next time, just ask, okay?”
My heart was racing. What was I doing? I felt instant regret.
Then I heard my phone beep.
“Next time?”
Out of nowhere I felt this longing to see his cock again. With my panties wrapped around it. I wanted to watch him do it.
“How about now?” I wrote impulsively.
“?” he replied instantly.
Did I really want to do this? What was I getting myself into?
Fuck it, I thought.
“Come down and play with my panties again…while I watch,” I texted.
My left hand was rubbing my clit through my panties as I typed on the phone with my right. I hadn’t felt turned on like this in ages. Maybe never quite like this.
My phone beeped again.
“Are you serious?”
I found myself getting almost annoyed at his hesitancy, firing off an instant reply.
“Yes! Now get the fuck down here already.”
I heard the floorboards creak. His room was directly above mine. And then his slow footsteps down the stairs. He knocked gently on my door. Walked in, smiling sheepishly.
He didn’t know what to say.
“I want to watch you jerk off in my panties,” I told him, suddenly feeling bold in a way that surprised me.
I lifted the bedcover off and moved so I was sitting on top of it instead. I indicated for him to come and sit next to me. He was still fully dressed and clearly nervous. I found it quite endearing. And it made me want to take charge like I never had before.
“Take your jeans and boxers off,” I told him.
He could hardly look at me, but did it immediately. I smiled when I saw his cock. So big and hard. Maybe he was nervous, but he was as turned on as I was.
“Now take my panties off for me.”
He looked at me, stunned. I could tell he was about to come out with this ‘are you serious’ line again, so I didn’t let him.
“Yes, I’m serious. Take them off. I want you to use these when you jerk off.”
I knelt up. He moved towards me. He slid his hands up the outside of my thighs, under my short nightdress, and up to my black panties. Yes, the ones I’d caught him playing with before.
Feeling his hands on me was mesmerizing. It was tempting to just have sex. But I was determined to watch him play with himself in my panties.
He peeled my panties off me. Instinctively he moved them straight to his face. I totally got off on watching him sniff my panties. I’d never even thought about anything like this and now it was driving my imagination wild.
Then he took my panties and, while looking into my eyes, wrapped them around his oh-so-delicious looking cock.
Instantly he let out a quiet moan as he touched himself for the first time.
I felt so wet that I was sure I was dripping.
I watched him rub himself slowly with my panties. I wasn’t even sure why this was such a turn on. But it was.
I sat on my bed, back to the wall, and parted my legs. I began to play with myself as he sat on the side of my bed rubbing himself harder and faster.
When he turned and saw me, his eyes widened.
“Fuuuucck,” I heard him whisper.
I could tell he was about to come soon.
I was desperate to see him come all over my panties. I don’t even know why. But I wanted it so badly. Needed it.
And then he did.
His body convulsed in front of me. And I watched as he came, covering my panties. I felt myself getting close to my own orgasm now too.
Another thought flashed into my mind.
“Lick my panties,” I told him. “I want to watch you lick your own cum out of my panties.”
James was so turned on he would have done anything.
And he did.
I watched him lick my panties, feeling more aroused than ever in my life.
“Now come and lick me.”
He didn’t hesitate. He lay between my legs, and moved his mouth to my pussy. I grabbed his head, pulling him tight towards me.
It didn’t take long. I was ready. Barely a minute after his tongue moved around my clit, I was ready to explode.
I squirted all over his face.
I’d never squirted before.I expect my Master soon
and knowing His pleasures, I must
prepare myself for His arrival.
I see myself reflected,
corsetted tight and waist nipped in
black, the way He wants me.
I look to check that
seams are straight and too high heels that
thrust my body into provocation.
I scent the room and
light soft candles, making shadows play upon
the body that will be His to use.
I find His ballgag and
part my lips to take it deep, and tighten the strap
so my cheeks bulge with violation.
I ensure His whip is hanging
where He may reach it when need arouses
and mark me in ways He pleases.
I caress the steel of cuffs
between my fingers, wanting to see them
glittering against yielding skin.
I feel compulsion in His iron bed
that will welcome my spread-eagled body
each shackle open with invitation.
I reach down to encircle ankles
to hear the sound of metal closing
moistening me wide for surrender.
I strain above my head to reach the bars
stretched tight is the way He wants me, I must
tighten steel upon my wrists.
I am here for Him now
knowing not when He will come, only that desire
will grow with the waiting.
I can only stare upwards
knowing that when He comes,
I will be only His.

tie me as your love demands
use me now and use me fully
force me down to your commands
I need to know your chains upon me
such craving there will always be
to want your ropes to hurt my body
so your bonds will set me free
Submission is my total needing
wanting you to make it so
taking me to places strangely
where I cannot help but go
You’re the one who now must hold me
I’ve sold myself to your control
with my freedom gone forever
now that you possess my soul
So tie me tighter yet and tighter
my screams must bite the gag you give
use my mind to make me suffer
this is how I want to live.

Mimi Bordeaux
Nov 7, 2016
Audrey is sitting in a cocktail lounge. She’s sipping her Cosmo, thinking to herself, ‘I deserve a night out. I work hard. It will be nice to enjoy a few drinks.’ She’s happy with her attire and looks elegant. She’s wearing a little black dress with a strand of pearls and her hair is tied up in a French roll.
A plain looking girl enters the bar. She never goes to bars but tonight she’s decided to be adventurous as it’s a warm summer evening. As she walks in she looks around nervously for an empty table. She is thinking, ‘I want to have an encounter… with anyone.’ She has never been in a proper relationship and at 26 she thinks it’s time.
She’s ordering her drink at the bar — a Shirley Temple — when she notices the elegant woman sitting there. Audrey is lost in her own thoughts, but her interest is piqued by Jane’s request for the non-alcoholic drink. She swings her bar stool around to look at her.
Jane summons up the courage to blurt out, “Oh hello… do you come here often?” She feels like a fool for her clichéd opening gambit, but she continues anyway. “I don’t usually go to bars, but here I am.”
Audrey coolly replies, “I like to go out alone and have a few drinks by myself.” She looks Jane up and down, notices that she’s actually rather sweet looking despite her plain clothes, senses her air of barely contained excitement. Her tone becomes warmer. “It’s quite dull here actually. How about you come back to my place and tell me all about yourself?”
“There’s not much to tell,” Jane says nervously, but before she really knows what’s happening she’s agreed to go back to Audrey’s place anyway.
It’s not far by taxi to Audrey’s luxurious apartment. ‘Oh, this is exciting!’ Jane thinks to herself. She still lives with her mother in an ordinary suburban house. Audrey offers her a drink and tells her to make herself comfortable, while she gets changed. She disappears through the double doors leading to her bedroom. Jane looks around; she’s never seen such opulence and she thinks Audrey must be very worldly.
Audrey returns. She has been busy putting on her outfit. She stands there, imposing, looking even taller in fishnet stockings and thigh high leather boots with spike heels. Her black corset barely contains her voluptuous breasts. She is wearing a dog collar around her neck and a black leather mask. She holds a black whip which she flicks every second.
She stares at Jane and says, “Go through that door,” gesturing towards a red leather door off the bedroom with the whip. Jane’s heart is racing. She’s apprehensive but excited by Audrey’s domineering tone. She does as she’s told and enters the room with Audrey following, flicking the whip at her behind. First softly, then a hard crack that stings Jane’s buttocks.
Jane perches on a stool in the middle of the room, the only place to sit, and glances around at her surroundings. Chains, ropes and leather straps hang from the ceiling and walls. She shivers at the sight.
Audrey slams the door shut and barks, “Did I give you permission to sit down?” Jane is confused. Audrey walks toward her, flicking the whip, and stands over her. “Open your legs.” Jane does as she’s told. “Are you getting wet? You must be excited.” Jane squirms, feeling wetness between the tops of her thighs. She’s never felt this way before. There’s a tingling sensation she can’t fathom. It’s because of Audrey.
Jane looks up. Audrey is staring at her and in a second has Jane’s head in her hands. She swipes her tongue up Jane’s cheek then to her mouth, biting hard on the lower lip. She rolls her tongue around Jane’s lips and forcefully enters her mouth, her tongue pushing in deep, grabbing onto Jane’s tongue with her teeth.
Audrey kneels, pulls Jane’s skirt and panties off and moves her head between Jane’s legs. Jane is quivering and needs to hold onto something but there’s nothing except Audrey. She puts her hands on Audrey’s head, winds her fingers into the elegantly coiffured hair. Audrey licks all the way from Jane’s asshole to her clit. She sticks her tongue in Jane’s cunt. In out, in out. She does it over and over again, licking Jane’s whole crack and tongue-fucking her deeper and deeper. Then she focuses on Jane’s clit, licking more softly.
Jane is overwhelmed by the attention and instinctively opens her legs wider. Audrey sucks and nibbles on her swollen clit, licking voraciously. Jane’s head is swimming, she thinks she may faint and her legs are trembling uncontrollably. There’s a fluttering in her stomach like an eel spinning around. She’s sweating, her chest is burning and her face is flushed. She’s on the verge of something, a sensation she’s never felt before. It’s building up from her toes, up her legs; between them she feels a gush of fluid. Suddenly she throws her head back, straining, her eyes tight shut; she grabs Audrey’s head and makes a high-pitched involuntary screech. She can’t think, see or hear any more, but she’s screaming out her pleasure as she slides off the stool.
“Shut up!” Audrey says harshly, pulling her to her feet and leading her by the neck to some ropes hanging from the ceiling. She ties Jane’s hands tightly and tells her to bend over. Jane is giddy, but she does as she’s told. There’s a sound behind her, then she feels something touching her cunt. It thrusts inside her, going right to the hilt, then out again. It goes in again and starts to move slowly, in out, in out. Jane moans as the thrusting becomes more intense.
Now it’s moving more quickly, sending waves of heat up Jane’s body. She moans and whispers, “Yes… oh yes!” as Audrey pumps her cunt with force. Audrey slams the dildo in, pressing at a special spot that has Jane intoxicated. Jane can’t hold back any longer and yells out, clutching at the rope, sweat dripping from her forehead, her cunt soaking wet and squirting juices that dribble down her thighs.
Audrey turns Jane around and thrusts the dildo into her mouth, making her gag for a moment before she adjusts to its size. “Suck!” says Audrey sternly. The dildo is coated with cum and Jane tastes her own juice for the first time.
Audrey unties Jane’s wrists and buckles a dog collar around her neck, with a short leash attached. She leads her to a wooden table. “Bend over and put your ass in the air, slut,” she commands her. The words have an instant effect on Jane, who feels her cunt swell and throb, more wetness trickling down her thighs. She’s so turned on.
Audrey holds onto the leash and rubs her finger against Jane’s asshole. Jane feels something cold and sticky being spread over her, and then Audrey’s fingertip wriggling into her ass. It feels strange, but good. The finger goes a little deeper, and then suddenly thrusts all the way inside. She yells.
“Shut up, slut,” Audrey says, adding a second finger and pumping them in and out of Jane’s ass. Jane lies flat against the table, ass up, and takes it. She starts to like it. She moans with each stroke.
“You like that do you, my little slut?” Audrey says, going deeper and faster. Jane is dizzy with excitement, growling and howling. Her orgasm fires through her whole body, radiating out from her core.
After a few minutes Audrey withdraws her fingers and Jane slumps down onto the table, exhausted. Audrey grabs the leash, making Jane stand, then removes the collar. She stares at Jane. She grabs her head and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck, then kisses her on the mouth.
“Time for you to go home,” she says. “You know the way out.” She marches Jane to the red door and pushes her through it, throwing her clothes after her. Jane dresses rapidly and staggers to the front door. Her pussy and ass are throbbing as she runs down the stairs. She’s floating. She feels like a bird in flight. She begins to walk.This girl looks exactly like me. The same long, wavy blonde hair. The same blue-grey eyes, the sprinkling of freckles over the bridge of her nose. The same slender fingers, moving to my nipple, as mine move to hers. We could be twins.
Only the tattoo on my back and the one on her foot mark us apart. She laughs when she undresses me and sees mine.
“Maybe I need to get one like it,” she says, getting down on her knees to kiss it, lick it; her tongue moving lower, down the cleft of my ass.
We met earlier that night, in a bar.
Coming face to face, I think for a moment that I’m walking into a mirror. We stare at each other for a long while, fascinated.
Before long we’ve both ditched our dates and are huddled in a corner, insulated from the noise of the bar by our absorption in each other. We’re drunk on the sight of each other, cataloguing the myriad points on which we are the same and the few tiny differences, obsessively.
“You’re just like me,” we keep telling each other.
When she asks my name and I say, ‘Narcisse,’ she laughs delightedly, getting the reference at once: Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection and died for love of himself.
She tells me hers is ‘Belle,’ which I know means beautiful; I’m not sure whether or not she’s lying but I like the inference, so I call her Belle anyway.
A little later and we’re sitting so close she’s practically on my lap, kissing avidly.
“Bet you’d fuck yourself if you could, wouldn’t you?” she says.
“Of course I would. Wouldn’t you?” She nods, unabashed. “Want to find out what it feels like?”
She nods again, runs a fingertip up my thigh as she leans in to whisper, “Your place or mine?”
My place then, the bedroom lights blazing so we can see every minute detail of each other as we undress, touch, explore. Every inch of her body looks strangely familiar. I lick each smooth expanse of skin as I uncover it, mapping the territory as I go, noting each hair and freckle. She shivers with arousal as I kiss her neck and then on downward, cupping a breast and sucking the nipple; she moans and I feel it harden against my tongue. Her responsiveness pleases me and my own nipples stiffen in sympathy, as if what I’m doing to her is physically mirrored in my own trembling flesh. I suck harder, my hands encircling her waist and running down over her hips.
I kiss and lick my way down her taut stomach, feeling it ripple at my light touch, then slide her panties down to her thighs and gaze at her pussy, enthralled. A neat tuft of blonde curls crowns her smooth, plump-lipped cunt. It’s like looking at myself from an angle I’ve never experienced before. I stare and stare until the intensity makes her fidget and she breaks the spell by pulling me onto the bed, breathless and flushed.
“What do you like?” she asks; meaning: how shall I get you off?
“You know what I like,” I reply, meaning: we’re the same. I like what you like.
Turns out I’m both right and wrong. She starts out gentle and teasing, kissing and licking around the edge of my skimpy panties, sucking my inner thigh, then licking me through the thin fabric until I’m dripping. By the time she peels my panties off and skims a fingertip along the slippery groove between my lips, I’m fighting the urge to tell her faster, harder, fuck me now! But it seems the teasing is what I wanted after all. Her touch is insistent, hypnotic, a slow build to a long drawn-out orgasm that has me screaming when she finally lets me come with three fingers plunging into my drenched hole and her lips suctioned around my clit.
I roll her onto her back and straddle her, kissing her insatiably, licking my cream from her lips. Pulling back to look into her eyes, I’m giddy with lust. For one vertiginous moment I feel as if I’m falling into a mirror, fucking myself into insanity.
Now all I can think about is tasting her. I spin around into a sixty-nine so I can hover my pussy over her face, too sensitive from my orgasm for much contact but shivering with arousal as she flicks her tongue delicately over my folds. My approach is more direct, more brutal; she’s shown me how she likes to be touched and now I’m teaching her my way. Spreading her open with my fingers, I swipe my tongue across her clit, over and over, relentless. My elbows pin her knees apart, my weight pinioning her so however much she squirms, she can’t escape the overpowering sensations. When she’s moaning and babbling deliriously, her hips juddering as she tries to hump up against my tongue, I thrust two fingers from each hand inside her, stretching her open and curling them to seek out her G-spot. Her hips buck so hard she nearly throws me off her as she comes, soaking my hands. She tastes just like me and that thought, coupled with the way she sucks fiercely at my cunt as she loses it, makes me come again.
We lie facing each other, and gaze into each other’s eyes, absorbing this information, the new things we’ve learned about ourselves from each other.
“I never knew I could come like that,” she says, wonderingly.
“I never knew I liked to be teased so much,” I laugh. She reaches for me again, kissing me hard as she slides one leg between my thighs, hooking the other over my hip. A little shuffling and we’re grinding together, pussy to pussy, both so hot and wet. There’s just enough friction to drive me out of my mind, my clit throbbing as I rub against her, hips moving in tight circles. This time, coming feels like hurtling down a long, dark tunnel into an explosion of light. I don’t know if the hammering against my chest is her heart or mine. The sense of consummation is profound.
We’ve been kissing and fingering, licking and sucking and fucking each other for so many hours it’s daylight when we finally disengage, blissed out and exhausted.
“Can I see you again,” she asks.
“You’ll see me every time you look in the mirror,” I reply.Watching your wife get fucked by another man is a real thrill, there is no doubt about that. But there are some cucks who want to take it even further. How can you go further than fucking? Cucks like me, we don’t just want our wives to cheat on us with their bodies. What we long for, more than anything else, is for our wives to develop real feelings for the bull.
It is called emotional cuckoldry. And it is not for the faint of heart. It is for people who are willing to really test their own inner strength. Maybe you suspect that it would be nice to watch your wife falling for another. I mean, it brings the excitement of competition to the surface, after all. But then, your heart gets kind of stamped on as she reveals to you the truth — that not only does he have a bigger cock than you, but he has also managed to awaken a real heart connection in her. Yes, that’s exciting too. But it is also incredibly scary. It means she might leave you.
And this is the real juice.
We emotional cuckolds must have had some abandonment issues in the past. And this fear of abandonment somehow is fused in our psyche with eroticism. So when the idea that our wife might leave first presents itself, the lump we feel in our throat is like nothing else. It unearths a desire and an excitement in us that is reckless — almost unlawful. Certainly taboo. We are not supposed to enjoy this. We must be masochistic, though, because we do. It hurts so good. So good.
It first happened to me with Ben, a guy that my wife had started fooling around with at work.
I knew she had a crush on him, that much she had confessed to me. But she hadn’t told me any of the details. I had assured her it was OK for her to pursue this crush, but she didn’t trust me, I guess. But finally, we had a date night, planned a week in advance, and I was able to get some of the details out of her.
It was dinner at The Corner Place, our favorite casual but awesome Italian. I waited until we had both ordered and had sipped a little red wine. Then I hit her with it.
“So, Lexy,” I said. “I’ve known you for a long time. You know, three years before we even started dating. Three years of dating. One year of marriage. That’s seven years.”
“Uh huh. Good math skills.”
She’s funny, I’ll give her that.
“I know you honey,” I said. “You can’t, you know…”
“I can’t what?”
“Well, I know you. And I would know if you weren’t, you know, telling me everything…”
“Oh, can we not talk about Ben tonight,” she said. “Can we just have a date night, me and you. Without Ben.”
“Of course.”
Shut down.
She shut me right down. Now I had to sit with these feelings. She was totally cheating on me. I mean, I knew she was cheating on me. But even this, being totally cheated on by the person who was cheating on me, by her withholding the details. Even this, I loved it.
It was a tortuous but lovely feeling.
We got through the whole date night. Got in bed, and I started making love to her. And as I was going down on her, I said, “Mmm, this tastes so good.” And then I just coyly asked her, “Has Ben tasted how good this tastes?”
“Mmmhmmm,” she murmured.
“I’m sorry,” I said, between licks of her clit. “Was that a yes?”
“Mmmmhmm,” she said.
“When did the lucky boy taste that?” I said, coming up for air.
“A couple days ago,” she gasped; she was almost ready to climax now. “We went back to his apartment at lunch. He wanted to fuck me. But I couldn’t.”
“So he just ate you,” I said.
“Mmmhmmm.”
“Did you cum?”
“Mmmhmmm.”
“And…”
“Oh shut up, I’m going to cum!”
And I concentrated on my work and made her cum real well. Then she went down and started reciprocating on my cock.
“Ah, and has Ben been as lucky as me in this regard?” I asked.
“Oh Jesus,” she said. “I’m trying to suck a dick here. Are you going to interrogate me or do you want a blow job?”
“Just nod or shake your head. Have you sucked his dick?”
She nodded.
I felt so good then. We were complete again. We weren’t holding anything back.
“Was it a nice dick?”
She shrugged her shoulders, then she nodded. I guessed it was a pretty nice dick.
“Bigger or smaller than mine?”
She made a kind of sing-songy noise. I didn’t hear it at first. But when she repeated it, I took her to be sing-songing “a little bigger.”
“A little bigger?”
She nodded.
“That’s good. That’s very good.”
It was so good in fact that I shot my load right then.
She was pissed.
“Josh!” she said. “I wanted to get fucked! I really wanted you to fuck me on our date night. Damn it.”
She got in bed next to me. But she wasn’t the one who should be pissed. It was her fault. She’d never told me this. And then, to find it out this way, through my subterfuge, it was all so exciting, I couldn’t help myself when I finally saw her nodding and admitting to a blow job. I just came like crazy.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” I said, finally asking the question that had been hanging between us.
“I’m sorry honey,” she said. “I just…I just didn’t feel like…you know, going through the details…I wanted it to be something…private, between me and Ben. Just this one private thing. I mean, I think that’s all it’s ever going to be. I don’t think I can bring myself to fuck him. So he ate my pussy and he made me cum and I sucked his cock and I made him cum, but–”
“Did he cum in your mouth?”
“See,” she said.
“See what?”
“This! I mean, I thought we could do this, Josh. I thought you could be…cooler about it. But maybe you can’t…handle it, I don’t know. I am going to call the whole thing off.”
“No! I can handle it!” I panicked. I was anxious that she was going to call the whole thing off. That was the last thing I wanted. “I don’t want you to call it off.”
It was then that she just broke down crying like crazy. I thought it was all my fault.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” I said to her. But through her blubbering, I gathered that it wasn’t my fault.
“What is it, then?” I asked.
“Oh, Josh,” she said. “I am so sorry. But…I think I’m falling in love with him. I’m sorry!”
“In love with Ben?”
“Yes,” she cried. “I’ve had a crush on him for months, yes. But now that we have been fooling around, Josh, I feel different with him, to how I feel with you. I’m so sorry. I feel…in my heart for him, something that I guess I didn’t know was there. But I think that’s what you’re supposed to feel in your heart for someone you fuck. I guess I shouldn’t have married you because I don’t feel that in my heart for you. I am so sorry. Oh God, I am so sorry about this. But it’s been driving me crazy and I’ve just got to be honest and tell you.”
“Tell me what?” I asked.
“I don’t love you, Josh,” she said, through a river of tears. “I’m sorry, I just don’t!”
When I woke up, she was packing a bag.
“What?” I said. “What are you doing?”
“What do you think I’m doing? Did you not hear what I told you last night? Were you drunk?”
“No,” I said. “I heard everything.”
“Then you know, that’s why I’m packing. I don’t love you, Josh. I’ve got to move out.”
“No you don’t,” I said. “That’s the last thing I want.”
“Right. You want to be married to someone who doesn’t love you? How fucked up is that?”
“Well, you might think it’s fucked up,” I said. “But Lexy, you know…it’s perfect for me. In so many ways. I mean, you know my upbringing…you know what I’m used to. My family didn’t love me. They didn’t even want me. So this is exactly what I’m comfortable with. I am just glad that it’s finally out in the open. I mean, you don’t think I knew that you didn’t love me? I mean, on our wedding day you were practically making out with Srivanda out on the balcony. I saw that, you know? The reason I picked you, unconsciously or consciously, must be because I have never felt loved and I wanted to continue that with my adult family.”
“So you want to stay with me, even though I don’t love you?”
She looked at me in disbelief.
“Yes,” I cried. “I love you more than ever now. This is what I want. Unrequited love. I want to suffer. I love it.”
“You love it.”
“Oh my God, if I could somehow let you experience what I experienced last night when you confessed this all to me. If you had been able to feel my chest, the compressions there. It was so intense. And then the back of my throat. It was such a pressure. And in my balls and my cock. I started almost cumming in my pants as you detailed how much you had been faking it, and how you really didn’t love me at all. It was so intense. It was painful and for some reason, the most pleasant feeling I have ever felt. After you went to sleep last night I went to the bathroom and I beat off ten times, I was so horny. Looking at you now, I think I’m going to cum again, just seeing your loveliness, and knowing that you don’t want me — it gives you an unbelievable power, don’t you see. You’ve become…Cleopatra. Royal. Beautiful beyond belief. You’ve become divine. A Goddess I can serve, but never equal. You’ve become…my dream come true.”
She looked at me like I was totally out of my mind.
“Wow, she said. “I did not…expect that.”
She put down her bags.
“So you want me to stay?”
“Yes!” I said. “Please stay.”
“Alright,” she said, looking bewildered. “I’ll stay. For now anyhow.”
And that’s how I became an emotional cuckold. My wife didn’t tell me details about her sex with her boyfriend any more. She shared details about her emotional connection with him. How he made her feel all girlie and excited. She took me shopping when she wanted to buy him a special gift. She wrote me emails and even handwritten letters about what a crush she had on him, how sexy he was, and how wonderful and special a person he was. She drew little hearts. She put her name and his name inside the heart. She took loads of special selfies of the two of them hugging and she sent them all to me. She shared herself and her affair with me totally. Even more than totally. I had the feeling that she was exaggerating a lot of it just because she understood me so perfectly. She knew that the worse she made it for me, the more jealous and shut out I felt, the more excited I got. And she took me there. All the way. She gave me the ultimate thrill. She made me into an emotional cuckold.
My wife. I love her so!I’m walking behind this girl in skintight yoga pants as she leaves the gym, watching her ass shimmy with every step she takes. I’m so mesmerized by the ripple effect that I barely even notice where I’m going. Does my ass jiggle like that when I walk? I can hardly grab it in the street to find out, but it doesn’t feel like it does. Now I’d like to grab her ass and feel her flesh bounce and shake as she sits on my face…
She goes into a coffee shop, and I follow, suddenly seized by a craving for caffeine (and pussy). She sits at a table by the window, catches my eye and smiles invitingly. I’m surprised I don’t recognize her — I thought I knew all the hot girls at my gym — but when I ask if I can join her, the effusive response makes it clear she’s noticed me before.
The morning’s progression is no less enjoyable for being entirely predictable. I’m in my comfort zone here, seducing cute girls being one of my favorite pastimes. Another coffee? Flirtatious chat. Her hand brushes my thigh as she leans across me to reach for the sugar, and she lets it linger there for a moment. Lunch? She lives nearby, she could make us something to eat…
I’ve been looking forward to peeling down those tight yoga pants, but as soon as we get inside her apartment she gives me a quick, promising kiss on the lips, and tells me she wants my opinion on her new outfit. She disappears into the bedroom, leaving me tingling pleasurably with anticipation; and returns a few moments later looking like a walking wet dream. Black lace lingerie, lace-topped stockings, garter belt, high heels; it might be a cliché, but it suits her hourglass figure perfectly. The panties cup her pussy so snugly I can see the hint of a cameltoe, and have a thong back that leaves her magnificent ass cheeks exposed.
Let’s find out what else makes her ass jiggle…
I soon reach the conclusion that those panties look even better around her thighs as I bend her forward over the couch and slot my tongue inside her creamy cunt. She’s so wet I don’t waste any more time with teasing, sucking up her sweetness, licking and rubbing until any hint of nervous inhibition has dissolved under my oral onslaught and she’s moaning and mashing her soaking pussy against my face. I adore feeling a girl shake apart as I eat her out, and I have a feeling I can guess what will push her over the edge.
I pull her panties right down so she can step out of them, then spread her legs — and her cheeks — wider. I was right, she goes wild as I paint her wetness up her ass crack with my tongue, lapping at the tight pucker until I feel her entire body shivering. I press deeper, opening her up little by little. Her legs are quivering, her booty quaking delightfully against my face, and as the tip of my tongue breaches that tight ring of muscle she has one of the fiercest assgasms I’ve ever given a girl, without any significant penetration.
Her legs are too wobbly to support her after that, so I lie back and pull her onto my face, sucking on her clit as I thrust a finger all the way into her ass. It feels almost impossibly tight at first, but a string of mini orgasms courtesy of my lashing tongue makes her loosen up, and then the way she squirms and squeals as I finger-fuck her ass lets me know I’m hitting the spot. But she really goes crazy when I turn her around so she’s sitting her ass on my face in a squat position and grind my knuckles over her clit as I lick her asshole as hard and deep as I can. I’m lucky she doesn’t suffocate me as she sags down on top of me, her body jerking convulsively… although it wouldn’t be a bad way to go, surrounded by twitching girl-flesh.
As first dates go, that was pretty intense. She’s too dazed (and, I suspect, inexperienced in the ways of lady lovin’) to get me off very effectively with her tongue and fingers, so I’m still horny as I go home and make what under the circumstances I can only describe as a “booty call” to my fuck buddy Tony.
I’m stripped down to my G-string, looking at my ass in the full-length mirror in my bedroom, as he answers the phone.
“Tony, does my ass jiggle?” I ask him, in lieu of saying hello. I bounce up and down a bit on the bed, watching for the ripple effect.
“No,” he replies, “your ass is a firm little peach, baby.”
“Not even when I go on the elliptical trainer at the gym?” I ask, vaguely disappointed.
“No. By the way, you know I’m at work, right? Can we not discuss your sexy ass and all the things I’d like to do to it right now, please.”
“Not even when you bend me over and fuck me from behind?”
“No, but it jiggles when I spank it, and you’d better believe you’re going to get a good hard spanking later!” he growls, hanging up.
So now I have my second challenge of the day: can I wait until Tony gets here to spank me until my cheeks are glowing and then fuck me hard enough to make them ripple like jello?
Or…Part ten: Turned on by a sexy plan
When I finished telling Angela’s story I knew I had to go to work, so I swung my legs around my makeup stool to enjoy the sensation of his erection between my breasts for a moment.
‘Does Sue know about you and Angela?’ he asked.
‘Oh yes. I don’t keep anything from her.’ I adjusted my bra so it was more comfortable.
‘Isn’t she jealous?’
‘No… and how could she be, given she is married to Ted?’
The humour was unintentional, but Liam nearly choked all the same. ‘Wait till I tell Toby that!’
‘What about Toby?’
‘You got a problem with me telling him? He is the only person other than Sue — and you — that has never run out on me. I always tell him everything, anyway, he is the only member of my family I have left.’
On day one, Sue and I had agreed that my house would be the one place where Toby could be himself, so I knew him pretty well. ‘No, of course not… anyway, he is such a nice guy.’
Liam looked unsure for a second. ‘Have you ever let him wear your clothes?’
I checked my mascara. There was no point being anything but honest. ‘Yes I have.’ I watched him in the mirror, because I had absolutely no idea what his reaction was going to be.
‘Sue usually lets him do it the moment Ted leaves for work. It felt kinda weird at first, but hey it’s no big deal, apart from when Ted comes home unexpectedly. Man, have we had some narrow escapes.’ He thought for a moment. ‘So, if you let him dress in your clothes, have you ever had… had…’
‘Had sex with him? No. Remember, he is only just eighteen.’ I gave him a stern look. ‘And before you ask, I don’t think Sue has, either.’
‘Just curious. I never know with Sue or you. If either of you did, it would be good for him. He once told me he couldn’t imagine any woman would ever want to have sex with him. Poor guy.’
Liam sounded so completely matter of fact about his brother’s cross dressing and the whole thing seemed so problematic that I let it drop. ‘Hey, I have an idea. Grab your clothes, I want you to come into work and meet someone.’
By the time I pulled the 911 up in my parking space, Liam had done everything except read the manual and take the vehicle to pieces to see how it worked. When we got out, he announced, ‘It’s awesome, but it’s not exactly the kind of car…’ his voice trailed away.
‘…that you expect a woman to own?’ I replied, my eyes glinting.
He recovered himself. ‘Sue says you only got the first one you bought because it was more powerful than Ted’s.’
That was true. I threw a smile over my shoulder. ‘Still remember his little darling face the first time he laid eyes on it.’
‘Why don’t you like him?’
‘Why does everybody not like him? If he wasn’t so certain that he was right and everyone else was wrong, he would be a damn sight easier to get along with.’ I had lost track of how much unsolicited advice Ted had given me over the years — printed out, it would have filled many boring volumes to bursting point.
‘Who am I going to meet?’
I pressed my key fob on the car park exit door. ‘Patience. You will find out soon enough.’
As we rode the elevator I adjusted his shirt. ‘You look great. I would fuck you right here if it wasn’t for the glass walls.’
Liam was still laughing when we reached my office. I threw my bag on a chair and spread my arms. ‘Make yourself at home. Want a coffee?’ When he nodded, I pressed a button on the intercom. ‘Two coffees, one for me and another black with sugar.’
I sank into my chair. This was going to be hugely entertaining, and I could only speculate at the outcome. But outcome there would be — I knew my PA inside out.
When Angela appeared with the coffee, she looked even more cheekily innocent than she normally did, assuming such a thing was possible. She gave Liam a dazzlingly shy smile of greeting, set down our coffees, and then walked very slowly around his chair, enjoying his puzzled appreciation. Men never seem to know how to respond to her, and he was no different — despite wearing a dress that was sensationally short, she managed to radiate her usual air of tomboyish virginity and I could tell he couldn’t cope with it at all. When she was standing right behind him, her coral lips formed the word, ‘Liam?’ and when I returned an imperceptible nod, she mimed sending a text. Then she was gone, leaving a waft of perfume to linger with her memory.
Liam was wide-eyed. ‘Who was that?’ he asked, jumping to his feet as soon as the door closed. He kept staring as if willpower alone could bring her back.
I studied my nails. ‘My PA. Now, drink your coffee, and be a love, I have some work to do.’
My phone went crazy with incoming texts, so many that in the end I excused myself and walked over to Angela’s office.
Her eyes were wide. ‘Is that really Liam?’
I sat on the edge of her desk. ‘Yep.’
She came up very close, spreading my legs so that she could stand between them. ‘I want to see you having sex with him.’
This was the Angela who had me in her palm. ‘You can’t,’ I whispered. ‘You just can’t!’
Her hand slipped inside my knickers and her fingertip went unerringly for its target. ‘You don’t understand. I really really want to see you have sex with him,’ she breathed, slipping two fingers inside as my pussy went to mush.
‘It isn’t possible,’ I hissed. ‘The situation is complicated enough as it is. Besides, you don’t even like having sex with men!’ On the last point I was confident, because in the time she had been with me I had established that Angela was almost exclusively lesbian in her tastes.
Angela didn’t let her eyes drop for a second as she began to work my clit with the ball of her thumb. ‘I don’t want to have sex with him,’ she replied, withdrawing her hand the precise moment before I would have come. ‘But I want to see you do it, and if you show me, then I will do anything you want me to do.’ This despite wearing an expression as if had she had just walked out of teaching Sunday school.
‘Do you want to be in the room with us, or what?’ Her finger was back at work, rubbing my clit through my panties now, and as the two layers of material slid against each other, the feeling began to build until I could hardly think straight. I was gripping the desk and had to force the words out.
‘All I want is to see him in here, filling you, while you squirm and sweat with lust. I know you won’t fail me. I want to see him sink into you until your pussy can take no more of him and then I want you to look at me when he comes.’ She increased her speed until I gasped and came, mostly for thinking of the scene she had just conjured up. Then I knelt while she stood over me and let me service her dripping slit. Her orgasms were quiet, controlled and ladylike, and as soon as they were done, she slipped two fingers deep inside before releasing her knickers. She held them out so I could them clean. ‘Another coffee?’ she asked, with a brilliant smile, for all the world as if she was seeking approval after finishing typing her first business letter.
In the end it turned out to be easier than I could possibly have hoped. After a brief struggle with my conscience, I rationalised that we used video in training all the time at work, so why not for teaching Liam about sex? When we got back home, I changed into a plunge bra and a dress I hadn’t worn in ages and worked the conversation around to the idea.
‘Like we do our own home porno flick?’ He sounded genuinely entertained by the idea. ‘If we do, I promise there won’t be any fast forward stuff.’
I took my courage in my hands and told him I wanted to film it with a proper video camera. To be honest, I could have told him that I wanted to video us having sex on a Swiss roll and he would probably have agreed — now that I had solved his problem he was desperate to make up for lost time.
The practical side of him soon took over. ‘But who is going to film it?’
With as much matter of factness as I could muster, I replied, ‘Angela. She does all our training videos,’ which was true, for I had spent thousands sending her on endless courses on editing and lighting. I just about managed to keep my voice level, because for all her expertise, it wasn’t quite the same as filming a blue movie.
I needn’t have worried. Liam blew out his lips at the thought, and shook his head, as though he couldn’t believe his luck. ‘Is there any chance that she…?’
‘Maybe, but she isn’t really much attracted to men, darling. Besides, I want you to myself for a while.’ I stroked his hair. ‘Angela says we are going to need two or three cameras, to get all the angles, so she will have her work cut out.’
Maybe Sue’s frank accounts of her sexual experiences had paved the way, but to this Liam said no more than, ‘Why not?’ Then, ‘You have already discussed this with her?’
I realised that I had very nearly let the cat out of the bag, so I leaned over, enjoying the thirst in his eyes as he drank in my cleavage. ‘You don’t fancy her more than me, I hope?’ I asked, pressing my upper arms against my boobs to make them pop.
He spluttered, ‘No, certainly not.’
‘But you do fancy her?’
‘Well, yeah, but who wouldn’t? Are you sure she is alright with this?’ He made it sound as if his major worry was that it wouldn’t go ahead. I felt a flood of relief, mixed with the sort of urgent sexual anticipation that only Angela could create in me.
‘Leave me to talk to her, okay? She does whatever I want.’ It was the only white lie of the evening.As they walked in the room he handed her an envelope. They were coming back from dinner at a posh place in the rooftop of one of the tallest buildings in London. She looked radiant in her little black dress and high heels. It was a celebration of sorts, and the night was still young.
He had flown in early in the afternoon and as soon as they had checked into the room they were fucking like bunnies. Going for dinner had been a necessary break to gather energy and fresh air for the encore session they were about to start. She looked in his mischievous eyes and asked:
“What’s in the envelope?”
He explained that he had written a bunch of positions on a set of cards and she could use them to choose the next position in which she wanted to be shagged. He was always having these unorthodox ideas, and now she was curious. She opened it up and found a familiar set of positions written down:
Missionary on the sofa
Monkey in the bathroom sink
Doggy standing by the mirror
Flat on the belly
…
One card caught her attention. She held it in her hand and looked up at his dark chocolatey eyes:
“What is upside down spoons?”
He answered that he would be happy to show her, as a naughty smile flashed across his face. She loved that look in his eyes, and felt her inner works jump with emotion. It made her feel so wanted, and gave her goosebumps. He helped her off with her coat, and then her shoes.
He had actually helped dress her up before dinner. He liked doing that, and she knew it was a strange kink but she liked it. As she had been lying naked in bed he had gathered the clothes she had brought for the occasion. He had gotten her garter belt on first, then her black stockings. He had then wrapped her up in her short black dress, no bra. And had finished by pulling her panties up.
She liked it when he did that to her. It was a special feeling of being cared for, even if it meant that she had to help with the stockings and correct her dress as she was getting her make up done in the bathroom.
As they were walking to the restaurant she felt some of their mixed juices dripping from her. During dinner it was a constant reminder of their hard workout that afternoon.
They started kissing. Soft in the lips. Her hands busy unbuttoning his shirt. His hands pulling up her dress. She was enjoying the feeling of his warm touch on her. And his hurry to get his hands under her clothes to caress her bare skin. He pulled the zipper of her dress down and helped her out of it, as she opened his shirt and got her hands on his chest.
They also liked undressing each other. It felt as if they were unwrapping their presents. She put her hands up to help him get her out of her dress. As he pushed her dress above her boobs, she started caressing him with soft touches of her fingernails.
She fell back onto the bed as he started kissing her right nipple. She loved the way he circled its tip with his tongue, making it wet and slurping on it until it felt as if her whole boob was made out of stone. As he moved to her other breast she could also feel how he was getting rid of his shirt and trousers.
She liked to lie in bed and have him do things to her. She had told him before how she enjoyed giving up control to him. After he got her second nipple wet and hard he started cruising her body with his mouth. Discovering every inch of her, kiss by kiss. As he got to the bottom of her rib cage she felt how he was sucking harder on her. He was marking the path through her using hickeys instead of breadcrumbs.
She was still lying in bed with her hands up and her dress covering her face. In a way as if she were blindfolded, except that she could free herself at any time. She felt him going down past her belly button and proceeding to her panties.
Her panties were wet, as in extra wet. He removed them and started exploring her vulva with his mouth. He found a little concentrate of their juices at her entrance. It almost felt like candy. He got as much as he could on the tip of his tongue and moved up to kiss her. He had to move the dress above her head to place the sweet dessert he had found on her mouth. She giggled when she realized what it was. As he was freeing her from her dress she asked him:
“So what about that upside down spoons you wrote about?”
He winked at her and moved her onto her side, as if he was going to spoon her from behind. Except that he placed his head at her feet and his knees on her back. He was indeed upside down from her. He opened up one of her legs as she reached for his shaft. It only took a few strokes to have him ready to go in. She placed the tip at her entrance and he moved up her hips to place himself in position.
The visuals were fantastic. She was so wet that he slid all the way in at the first push. He was kissing her left leg and holding her by her waist. She liked seeing how his cock was moving in and out of her. He told her with a wicked smile:
“ Remember how I told you I wanted to see how you masturbate? Well, now is the time. Show me how you touch yourself when we are not together and you are missing me!”
He got her hand on top of her clit and she started her little number, with two fingertips going up and down on top of it. He was moving slowly in and out, as she reached to his shaft to get some of their juices on her fingertips. Her fingers continued the dancing routine, except that the intimate atmosphere had now been replaced by the voyeurism of feeling his stare on her.
This felt so extremely hot to him. He could see in her face what she was experiencing. Every now and then she flashed a smile at him and looked in his eyes. She still had her stockings and garter belt on, and the view of her fantastic body from his vantage point was something out of this world. He could see in her expression how she was concentrating on her orgasm.
Her fingers were doing the final strokes and she knew she would be over the edge soon. The slow in and out dance was helping her build up. She opened her mouth to tell him:
“I am about to come…”
And with a few more caresses she arched her back and released the next batch of energy. He parked his cock all the way inside of her and could feel her shaking surrounding him. He was looking at her, as a spectator who has been given access to a very private show. A show built up of their love, of their want of each other, and from the build up of the days that they had not been together.
They agreed that these are the moments worth living for.Don’t speak to me with words
Talk with lips on skin
Scream with fingers on my back

9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.

I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.
Follow MyErotica for refined erotic fiction to ignite your deepest desires.Shallow breaths
As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
HeThe first time, I was pretty sure I was seeing things. I was in my towel, fresh out the shower, ready to pick my undies before heading out for my uni class in town. Deciding what to wear, I had this vague, mostly subconscious sense that my bras and panties weren’t quite laid out how they were the previous morning.
The second time, I was convinced someone had been in my panty drawer. Some of my panties and thongs we definitely not arranged how I’d left them.
I felt pissed. Which of my housemates was going through my personal stuff? There were five of us living together. Two girls, three guys. None of them seemed the sort who’d go through my lingerie. Then again: how would I know?
The third time I caught him. Sat on my bed, with my favorite black lace panties wrapped around his cock. He was pumping himself hard and fast.
“What the fuck, James?” I said angrily, turning on the light.
“Shit,” was all he managed. And then again: “Shit.”
I’ve never seen anyone look so panicked. Deer in the headlights didn’t come close to it.
He took my panties off his cock, left them on my bed, and zipped himself back up. Then, unable to look me in the eyes, he walked straight past me, head down, and up to his top floor bedroom.
Two hours later I was lying in bed, unable to sleep.
The anger had subsided. Bizarrely, the initial feelings of violation had now turned to intrigue.
I’d never thought of any of my housemates as anything but friends. And now suddenly I couldn’t help but think about James differently.
He was into me.
My thoughts lingered for a moment on seeing his cock.
Out of nowhere, I felt a slight shudder of pleasure go through me thinking about my sexiest panties wrapped around it. Without even realizing, my hand had slipped down between my legs.
What was I thinking? I was shocked at myself. I wanted to feel angry again. That was the normal response I should be having. Right? But I couldn’t get the anger back. Suddenly the whole thing felt thrilling.
Before I could stop myself, I picked up my phone. And I texted him.
“Next time, just ask, okay?”
My heart was racing. What was I doing? I felt instant regret.
Then I heard my phone beep.
“Next time?”
Out of nowhere I felt this longing to see his cock again. With my panties wrapped around it. I wanted to watch him do it.
“How about now?” I wrote impulsively.
“?” he replied instantly.
Did I really want to do this? What was I getting myself into?
Fuck it, I thought.
“Come down and play with my panties again…while I watch,” I texted.
My left hand was rubbing my clit through my panties as I typed on the phone with my right. I hadn’t felt turned on like this in ages. Maybe never quite like this.
My phone beeped again.
“Are you serious?”
I found myself getting almost annoyed at his hesitancy, firing off an instant reply.
“Yes! Now get the fuck down here already.”
I heard the floorboards creak. His room was directly above mine. And then his slow footsteps down the stairs. He knocked gently on my door. Walked in, smiling sheepishly.
He didn’t know what to say.
“I want to watch you jerk off in my panties,” I told him, suddenly feeling bold in a way that surprised me.
I lifted the bedcover off and moved so I was sitting on top of it instead. I indicated for him to come and sit next to me. He was still fully dressed and clearly nervous. I found it quite endearing. And it made me want to take charge like I never had before.
“Take your jeans and boxers off,” I told him.
He could hardly look at me, but did it immediately. I smiled when I saw his cock. So big and hard. Maybe he was nervous, but he was as turned on as I was.
“Now take my panties off for me.”
He looked at me, stunned. I could tell he was about to come out with this ‘are you serious’ line again, so I didn’t let him.
“Yes, I’m serious. Take them off. I want you to use these when you jerk off.”
I knelt up. He moved towards me. He slid his hands up the outside of my thighs, under my short nightdress, and up to my black panties. Yes, the ones I’d caught him playing with before.
Feeling his hands on me was mesmerizing. It was tempting to just have sex. But I was determined to watch him play with himself in my panties.
He peeled my panties off me. Instinctively he moved them straight to his face. I totally got off on watching him sniff my panties. I’d never even thought about anything like this and now it was driving my imagination wild.
Then he took my panties and, while looking into my eyes, wrapped them around his oh-so-delicious looking cock.
Instantly he let out a quiet moan as he touched himself for the first time.
I felt so wet that I was sure I was dripping.
I watched him rub himself slowly with my panties. I wasn’t even sure why this was such a turn on. But it was.
I sat on my bed, back to the wall, and parted my legs. I began to play with myself as he sat on the side of my bed rubbing himself harder and faster.
When he turned and saw me, his eyes widened.
“Fuuuucck,” I heard him whisper.
I could tell he was about to come soon.
I was desperate to see him come all over my panties. I don’t even know why. But I wanted it so badly. Needed it.
And then he did.
His body convulsed in front of me. And I watched as he came, covering my panties. I felt myself getting close to my own orgasm now too.
Another thought flashed into my mind.
“Lick my panties,” I told him. “I want to watch you lick your own cum out of my panties.”
James was so turned on he would have done anything.
And he did.
I watched him lick my panties, feeling more aroused than ever in my life.
“Now come and lick me.”
He didn’t hesitate. He lay between my legs, and moved his mouth to my pussy. I grabbed his head, pulling him tight towards me.
It didn’t take long. I was ready. Barely a minute after his tongue moved around my clit, I was ready to explode.
I squirted all over his face.
I’d never squirted before.I expect my Master soon
and knowing His pleasures, I must
prepare myself for His arrival.
I see myself reflected,
corsetted tight and waist nipped in
black, the way He wants me.
I look to check that
seams are straight and too high heels that
thrust my body into provocation.
I scent the room and
light soft candles, making shadows play upon
the body that will be His to use.
I find His ballgag and
part my lips to take it deep, and tighten the strap
so my cheeks bulge with violation.
I ensure His whip is hanging
where He may reach it when need arouses
and mark me in ways He pleases.
I caress the steel of cuffs
between my fingers, wanting to see them
glittering against yielding skin.
I feel compulsion in His iron bed
that will welcome my spread-eagled body
each shackle open with invitation.
I reach down to encircle ankles
to hear the sound of metal closing
moistening me wide for surrender.
I strain above my head to reach the bars
stretched tight is the way He wants me, I must
tighten steel upon my wrists.
I am here for Him now
knowing not when He will come, only that desire
will grow with the waiting.
I can only stare upwards
knowing that when He comes,
I will be only His.
101 Poems for kinky lovers, by Francesca Anderssen is available in paperback and on the Amazon kindle marketplace.Take me as your very own
tie me as your love demands
use me now and use me fully
force me down to your commands
I need to know your chains upon me
such craving there will always be
to want your ropes to hurt my body
so your bonds will set me free
Submission is my total needing
wanting you to make it so
taking me to places strangely
where I cannot help but go
You’re the one who now must hold me
I’ve sold myself to your control
with my freedom gone forever
now that you possess my soul
So tie me tighter yet and tighter
my screams must bite the gag you give
use my mind to make me suffer
this is how I want to live.

Mimi Bordeaux
Nov 7, 2016
Audrey is sitting in a cocktail lounge. She’s sipping her Cosmo, thinking to herself, ‘I deserve a night out. I work hard. It will be nice to enjoy a few drinks.’ She’s happy with her attire and looks elegant. She’s wearing a little black dress with a strand of pearls and her hair is tied up in a French roll.
A plain looking girl enters the bar. She never goes to bars but tonight she’s decided to be adventurous as it’s a warm summer evening. As she walks in she looks around nervously for an empty table. She is thinking, ‘I want to have an encounter… with anyone.’ She has never been in a proper relationship and at 26 she thinks it’s time.
She’s ordering her drink at the bar — a Shirley Temple — when she notices the elegant woman sitting there. Audrey is lost in her own thoughts, but her interest is piqued by Jane’s request for the non-alcoholic drink. She swings her bar stool around to look at her.
Jane summons up the courage to blurt out, “Oh hello… do you come here often?” She feels like a fool for her clichéd opening gambit, but she continues anyway. “I don’t usually go to bars, but here I am.”
Audrey coolly replies, “I like to go out alone and have a few drinks by myself.” She looks Jane up and down, notices that she’s actually rather sweet looking despite her plain clothes, senses her air of barely contained excitement. Her tone becomes warmer. “It’s quite dull here actually. How about you come back to my place and tell me all about yourself?”
“There’s not much to tell,” Jane says nervously, but before she really knows what’s happening she’s agreed to go back to Audrey’s place anyway.
It’s not far by taxi to Audrey’s luxurious apartment. ‘Oh, this is exciting!’ Jane thinks to herself. She still lives with her mother in an ordinary suburban house. Audrey offers her a drink and tells her to make herself comfortable, while she gets changed. She disappears through the double doors leading to her bedroom. Jane looks around; she’s never seen such opulence and she thinks Audrey must be very worldly.
Audrey returns. She has been busy putting on her outfit. She stands there, imposing, looking even taller in fishnet stockings and thigh high leather boots with spike heels. Her black corset barely contains her voluptuous breasts. She is wearing a dog collar around her neck and a black leather mask. She holds a black whip which she flicks every second.
She stares at Jane and says, “Go through that door,” gesturing towards a red leather door off the bedroom with the whip. Jane’s heart is racing. She’s apprehensive but excited by Audrey’s domineering tone. She does as she’s told and enters the room with Audrey following, flicking the whip at her behind. First softly, then a hard crack that stings Jane’s buttocks.
Jane perches on a stool in the middle of the room, the only place to sit, and glances around at her surroundings. Chains, ropes and leather straps hang from the ceiling and walls. She shivers at the sight.
Audrey slams the door shut and barks, “Did I give you permission to sit down?” Jane is confused. Audrey walks toward her, flicking the whip, and stands over her. “Open your legs.” Jane does as she’s told. “Are you getting wet? You must be excited.” Jane squirms, feeling wetness between the tops of her thighs. She’s never felt this way before. There’s a tingling sensation she can’t fathom. It’s because of Audrey.
Jane looks up. Audrey is staring at her and in a second has Jane’s head in her hands. She swipes her tongue up Jane’s cheek then to her mouth, biting hard on the lower lip. She rolls her tongue around Jane’s lips and forcefully enters her mouth, her tongue pushing in deep, grabbing onto Jane’s tongue with her teeth.
Audrey kneels, pulls Jane’s skirt and panties off and moves her head between Jane’s legs. Jane is quivering and needs to hold onto something but there’s nothing except Audrey. She puts her hands on Audrey’s head, winds her fingers into the elegantly coiffured hair. Audrey licks all the way from Jane’s asshole to her clit. She sticks her tongue in Jane’s cunt. In out, in out. She does it over and over again, licking Jane’s whole crack and tongue-fucking her deeper and deeper. Then she focuses on Jane’s clit, licking more softly.
Jane is overwhelmed by the attention and instinctively opens her legs wider. Audrey sucks and nibbles on her swollen clit, licking voraciously. Jane’s head is swimming, she thinks she may faint and her legs are trembling uncontrollably. There’s a fluttering in her stomach like an eel spinning around. She’s sweating, her chest is burning and her face is flushed. She’s on the verge of something, a sensation she’s never felt before. It’s building up from her toes, up her legs; between them she feels a gush of fluid. Suddenly she throws her head back, straining, her eyes tight shut; she grabs Audrey’s head and makes a high-pitched involuntary screech. She can’t think, see or hear any more, but she’s screaming out her pleasure as she slides off the stool.
“Shut up!” Audrey says harshly, pulling her to her feet and leading her by the neck to some ropes hanging from the ceiling. She ties Jane’s hands tightly and tells her to bend over. Jane is giddy, but she does as she’s told. There’s a sound behind her, then she feels something touching her cunt. It thrusts inside her, going right to the hilt, then out again. It goes in again and starts to move slowly, in out, in out. Jane moans as the thrusting becomes more intense.
Now it’s moving more quickly, sending waves of heat up Jane’s body. She moans and whispers, “Yes… oh yes!” as Audrey pumps her cunt with force. Audrey slams the dildo in, pressing at a special spot that has Jane intoxicated. Jane can’t hold back any longer and yells out, clutching at the rope, sweat dripping from her forehead, her cunt soaking wet and squirting juices that dribble down her thighs.
Audrey turns Jane around and thrusts the dildo into her mouth, making her gag for a moment before she adjusts to its size. “Suck!” says Audrey sternly. The dildo is coated with cum and Jane tastes her own juice for the first time.
Audrey unties Jane’s wrists and buckles a dog collar around her neck, with a short leash attached. She leads her to a wooden table. “Bend over and put your ass in the air, slut,” she commands her. The words have an instant effect on Jane, who feels her cunt swell and throb, more wetness trickling down her thighs. She’s so turned on.
Audrey holds onto the leash and rubs her finger against Jane’s asshole. Jane feels something cold and sticky being spread over her, and then Audrey’s fingertip wriggling into her ass. It feels strange, but good. The finger goes a little deeper, and then suddenly thrusts all the way inside. She yells.
“Shut up, slut,” Audrey says, adding a second finger and pumping them in and out of Jane’s ass. Jane lies flat against the table, ass up, and takes it. She starts to like it. She moans with each stroke.
“You like that do you, my little slut?” Audrey says, going deeper and faster. Jane is dizzy with excitement, growling and howling. Her orgasm fires through her whole body, radiating out from her core.
After a few minutes Audrey withdraws her fingers and Jane slumps down onto the table, exhausted. Audrey grabs the leash, making Jane stand, then removes the collar. She stares at Jane. She grabs her head and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck, then kisses her on the mouth.
“Time for you to go home,” she says. “You know the way out.” She marches Jane to the red door and pushes her through it, throwing her clothes after her. Jane dresses rapidly and staggers to the front door. Her pussy and ass are throbbing as she runs down the stairs. She’s floating. She feels like a bird in flight. She begins to walk.This girl looks exactly like me. The same long, wavy blonde hair. The same blue-grey eyes, the sprinkling of freckles over the bridge of her nose. The same slender fingers, moving to my nipple, as mine move to hers. We could be twins.
Only the tattoo on my back and the one on her foot mark us apart. She laughs when she undresses me and sees mine.
“Maybe I need to get one like it,” she says, getting down on her knees to kiss it, lick it; her tongue moving lower, down the cleft of my ass.
We met earlier that night, in a bar.
Coming face to face, I think for a moment that I’m walking into a mirror. We stare at each other for a long while, fascinated.
Before long we’ve both ditched our dates and are huddled in a corner, insulated from the noise of the bar by our absorption in each other. We’re drunk on the sight of each other, cataloguing the myriad points on which we are the same and the few tiny differences, obsessively.
“You’re just like me,” we keep telling each other.
When she asks my name and I say, ‘Narcisse,’ she laughs delightedly, getting the reference at once: Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection and died for love of himself.
She tells me hers is ‘Belle,’ which I know means beautiful; I’m not sure whether or not she’s lying but I like the inference, so I call her Belle anyway.
A little later and we’re sitting so close she’s practically on my lap, kissing avidly.
“Bet you’d fuck yourself if you could, wouldn’t you?” she says.
“Of course I would. Wouldn’t you?” She nods, unabashed. “Want to find out what it feels like?”
She nods again, runs a fingertip up my thigh as she leans in to whisper, “Your place or mine?”
My place then, the bedroom lights blazing so we can see every minute detail of each other as we undress, touch, explore. Every inch of her body looks strangely familiar. I lick each smooth expanse of skin as I uncover it, mapping the territory as I go, noting each hair and freckle. She shivers with arousal as I kiss her neck and then on downward, cupping a breast and sucking the nipple; she moans and I feel it harden against my tongue. Her responsiveness pleases me and my own nipples stiffen in sympathy, as if what I’m doing to her is physically mirrored in my own trembling flesh. I suck harder, my hands encircling her waist and running down over her hips.
I kiss and lick my way down her taut stomach, feeling it ripple at my light touch, then slide her panties down to her thighs and gaze at her pussy, enthralled. A neat tuft of blonde curls crowns her smooth, plump-lipped cunt. It’s like looking at myself from an angle I’ve never experienced before. I stare and stare until the intensity makes her fidget and she breaks the spell by pulling me onto the bed, breathless and flushed.
“What do you like?” she asks; meaning: how shall I get you off?
“You know what I like,” I reply, meaning: we’re the same. I like what you like.
Turns out I’m both right and wrong. She starts out gentle and teasing, kissing and licking around the edge of my skimpy panties, sucking my inner thigh, then licking me through the thin fabric until I’m dripping. By the time she peels my panties off and skims a fingertip along the slippery groove between my lips, I’m fighting the urge to tell her faster, harder, fuck me now! But it seems the teasing is what I wanted after all. Her touch is insistent, hypnotic, a slow build to a long drawn-out orgasm that has me screaming when she finally lets me come with three fingers plunging into my drenched hole and her lips suctioned around my clit.
I roll her onto her back and straddle her, kissing her insatiably, licking my cream from her lips. Pulling back to look into her eyes, I’m giddy with lust. For one vertiginous moment I feel as if I’m falling into a mirror, fucking myself into insanity.
Now all I can think about is tasting her. I spin around into a sixty-nine so I can hover my pussy over her face, too sensitive from my orgasm for much contact but shivering with arousal as she flicks her tongue delicately over my folds. My approach is more direct, more brutal; she’s shown me how she likes to be touched and now I’m teaching her my way. Spreading her open with my fingers, I swipe my tongue across her clit, over and over, relentless. My elbows pin her knees apart, my weight pinioning her so however much she squirms, she can’t escape the overpowering sensations. When she’s moaning and babbling deliriously, her hips juddering as she tries to hump up against my tongue, I thrust two fingers from each hand inside her, stretching her open and curling them to seek out her G-spot. Her hips buck so hard she nearly throws me off her as she comes, soaking my hands. She tastes just like me and that thought, coupled with the way she sucks fiercely at my cunt as she loses it, makes me come again.
We lie facing each other, and gaze into each other’s eyes, absorbing this information, the new things we’ve learned about ourselves from each other.
“I never knew I could come like that,” she says, wonderingly.
“I never knew I liked to be teased so much,” I laugh. She reaches for me again, kissing me hard as she slides one leg between my thighs, hooking the other over my hip. A little shuffling and we’re grinding together, pussy to pussy, both so hot and wet. There’s just enough friction to drive me out of my mind, my clit throbbing as I rub against her, hips moving in tight circles. This time, coming feels like hurtling down a long, dark tunnel into an explosion of light. I don’t know if the hammering against my chest is her heart or mine. The sense of consummation is profound.
We’ve been kissing and fingering, licking and sucking and fucking each other for so many hours it’s daylight when we finally disengage, blissed out and exhausted.
“Can I see you again,” she asks.
“You’ll see me every time you look in the mirror,” I reply.Watching your wife get fucked by another man is a real thrill, there is no doubt about that. But there are some cucks who want to take it even further. How can you go further than fucking? Cucks like me, we don’t just want our wives to cheat on us with their bodies. What we long for, more than anything else, is for our wives to develop real feelings for the bull.
It is called emotional cuckoldry. And it is not for the faint of heart. It is for people who are willing to really test their own inner strength. Maybe you suspect that it would be nice to watch your wife falling for another. I mean, it brings the excitement of competition to the surface, after all. But then, your heart gets kind of stamped on as she reveals to you the truth — that not only does he have a bigger cock than you, but he has also managed to awaken a real heart connection in her. Yes, that’s exciting too. But it is also incredibly scary. It means she might leave you.
And this is the real juice.
We emotional cuckolds must have had some abandonment issues in the past. And this fear of abandonment somehow is fused in our psyche with eroticism. So when the idea that our wife might leave first presents itself, the lump we feel in our throat is like nothing else. It unearths a desire and an excitement in us that is reckless — almost unlawful. Certainly taboo. We are not supposed to enjoy this. We must be masochistic, though, because we do. It hurts so good. So good.
It first happened to me with Ben, a guy that my wife had started fooling around with at work.
I knew she had a crush on him, that much she had confessed to me. But she hadn’t told me any of the details. I had assured her it was OK for her to pursue this crush, but she didn’t trust me, I guess. But finally, we had a date night, planned a week in advance, and I was able to get some of the details out of her.
It was dinner at The Corner Place, our favorite casual but awesome Italian. I waited until we had both ordered and had sipped a little red wine. Then I hit her with it.
“So, Lexy,” I said. “I’ve known you for a long time. You know, three years before we even started dating. Three years of dating. One year of marriage. That’s seven years.”
“Uh huh. Good math skills.”
She’s funny, I’ll give her that.
“I know you honey,” I said. “You can’t, you know…”
“I can’t what?”
“Well, I know you. And I would know if you weren’t, you know, telling me everything…”
“Oh, can we not talk about Ben tonight,” she said. “Can we just have a date night, me and you. Without Ben.”
“Of course.”
Shut down.
She shut me right down. Now I had to sit with these feelings. She was totally cheating on me. I mean, I knew she was cheating on me. But even this, being totally cheated on by the person who was cheating on me, by her withholding the details. Even this, I loved it.
It was a tortuous but lovely feeling.
We got through the whole date night. Got in bed, and I started making love to her. And as I was going down on her, I said, “Mmm, this tastes so good.” And then I just coyly asked her, “Has Ben tasted how good this tastes?”
“Mmmhmmm,” she murmured.
“I’m sorry,” I said, between licks of her clit. “Was that a yes?”
“Mmmmhmm,” she said.
“When did the lucky boy taste that?” I said, coming up for air.
“A couple days ago,” she gasped; she was almost ready to climax now. “We went back to his apartment at lunch. He wanted to fuck me. But I couldn’t.”
“So he just ate you,” I said.
“Mmmhmmm.”
“Did you cum?”
“Mmmhmmm.”
“And…”
“Oh shut up, I’m going to cum!”
And I concentrated on my work and made her cum real well. Then she went down and started reciprocating on my cock.
“Ah, and has Ben been as lucky as me in this regard?” I asked.
“Oh Jesus,” she said. “I’m trying to suck a dick here. Are you going to interrogate me or do you want a blow job?”
“Just nod or shake your head. Have you sucked his dick?”
She nodded.
I felt so good then. We were complete again. We weren’t holding anything back.
“Was it a nice dick?”
She shrugged her shoulders, then she nodded. I guessed it was a pretty nice dick.
“Bigger or smaller than mine?”
She made a kind of sing-songy noise. I didn’t hear it at first. But when she repeated it, I took her to be sing-songing “a little bigger.”
“A little bigger?”
She nodded.
“That’s good. That’s very good.”
It was so good in fact that I shot my load right then.
She was pissed.
“Josh!” she said. “I wanted to get fucked! I really wanted you to fuck me on our date night. Damn it.”
She got in bed next to me. But she wasn’t the one who should be pissed. It was her fault. She’d never told me this. And then, to find it out this way, through my subterfuge, it was all so exciting, I couldn’t help myself when I finally saw her nodding and admitting to a blow job. I just came like crazy.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” I said, finally asking the question that had been hanging between us.
“I’m sorry honey,” she said. “I just…I just didn’t feel like…you know, going through the details…I wanted it to be something…private, between me and Ben. Just this one private thing. I mean, I think that’s all it’s ever going to be. I don’t think I can bring myself to fuck him. So he ate my pussy and he made me cum and I sucked his cock and I made him cum, but–”
“Did he cum in your mouth?”
“See,” she said.
“See what?”
“This! I mean, I thought we could do this, Josh. I thought you could be…cooler about it. But maybe you can’t…handle it, I don’t know. I am going to call the whole thing off.”
“No! I can handle it!” I panicked. I was anxious that she was going to call the whole thing off. That was the last thing I wanted. “I don’t want you to call it off.”
It was then that she just broke down crying like crazy. I thought it was all my fault.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” I said to her. But through her blubbering, I gathered that it wasn’t my fault.
“What is it, then?” I asked.
“Oh, Josh,” she said. “I am so sorry. But…I think I’m falling in love with him. I’m sorry!”
“In love with Ben?”
“Yes,” she cried. “I’ve had a crush on him for months, yes. But now that we have been fooling around, Josh, I feel different with him, to how I feel with you. I’m so sorry. I feel…in my heart for him, something that I guess I didn’t know was there. But I think that’s what you’re supposed to feel in your heart for someone you fuck. I guess I shouldn’t have married you because I don’t feel that in my heart for you. I am so sorry. Oh God, I am so sorry about this. But it’s been driving me crazy and I’ve just got to be honest and tell you.”
“Tell me what?” I asked.
“I don’t love you, Josh,” she said, through a river of tears. “I’m sorry, I just don’t!”
When I woke up, she was packing a bag.
“What?” I said. “What are you doing?”
“What do you think I’m doing? Did you not hear what I told you last night? Were you drunk?”
“No,” I said. “I heard everything.”
“Then you know, that’s why I’m packing. I don’t love you, Josh. I’ve got to move out.”
“No you don’t,” I said. “That’s the last thing I want.”
“Right. You want to be married to someone who doesn’t love you? How fucked up is that?”
“Well, you might think it’s fucked up,” I said. “But Lexy, you know…it’s perfect for me. In so many ways. I mean, you know my upbringing…you know what I’m used to. My family didn’t love me. They didn’t even want me. So this is exactly what I’m comfortable with. I am just glad that it’s finally out in the open. I mean, you don’t think I knew that you didn’t love me? I mean, on our wedding day you were practically making out with Srivanda out on the balcony. I saw that, you know? The reason I picked you, unconsciously or consciously, must be because I have never felt loved and I wanted to continue that with my adult family.”
“So you want to stay with me, even though I don’t love you?”
She looked at me in disbelief.
“Yes,” I cried. “I love you more than ever now. This is what I want. Unrequited love. I want to suffer. I love it.”
“You love it.”
“Oh my God, if I could somehow let you experience what I experienced last night when you confessed this all to me. If you had been able to feel my chest, the compressions there. It was so intense. And then the back of my throat. It was such a pressure. And in my balls and my cock. I started almost cumming in my pants as you detailed how much you had been faking it, and how you really didn’t love me at all. It was so intense. It was painful and for some reason, the most pleasant feeling I have ever felt. After you went to sleep last night I went to the bathroom and I beat off ten times, I was so horny. Looking at you now, I think I’m going to cum again, just seeing your loveliness, and knowing that you don’t want me — it gives you an unbelievable power, don’t you see. You’ve become…Cleopatra. Royal. Beautiful beyond belief. You’ve become divine. A Goddess I can serve, but never equal. You’ve become…my dream come true.”
She looked at me like I was totally out of my mind.
“Wow, she said. “I did not…expect that.”
She put down her bags.
“So you want me to stay?”
“Yes!” I said. “Please stay.”
“Alright,” she said, looking bewildered. “I’ll stay. For now anyhow.”
And that’s how I became an emotional cuckold. My wife didn’t tell me details about her sex with her boyfriend any more. She shared details about her emotional connection with him. How he made her feel all girlie and excited. She took me shopping when she wanted to buy him a special gift. She wrote me emails and even handwritten letters about what a crush she had on him, how sexy he was, and how wonderful and special a person he was. She drew little hearts. She put her name and his name inside the heart. She took loads of special selfies of the two of them hugging and she sent them all to me. She shared herself and her affair with me totally. Even more than totally. I had the feeling that she was exaggerating a lot of it just because she understood me so perfectly. She knew that the worse she made it for me, the more jealous and shut out I felt, the more excited I got. And she took me there. All the way. She gave me the ultimate thrill. She made me into an emotional cuckold.
My wife. I love her so!I’m walking behind this girl in skintight yoga pants as she leaves the gym, watching her ass shimmy with every step she takes. I’m so mesmerized by the ripple effect that I barely even notice where I’m going. Does my ass jiggle like that when I walk? I can hardly grab it in the street to find out, but it doesn’t feel like it does. Now I’d like to grab her ass and feel her flesh bounce and shake as she sits on my face…
She goes into a coffee shop, and I follow, suddenly seized by a craving for caffeine (and pussy). She sits at a table by the window, catches my eye and smiles invitingly. I’m surprised I don’t recognize her — I thought I knew all the hot girls at my gym — but when I ask if I can join her, the effusive response makes it clear she’s noticed me before.
The morning’s progression is no less enjoyable for being entirely predictable. I’m in my comfort zone here, seducing cute girls being one of my favorite pastimes. Another coffee? Flirtatious chat. Her hand brushes my thigh as she leans across me to reach for the sugar, and she lets it linger there for a moment. Lunch? She lives nearby, she could make us something to eat…
I’ve been looking forward to peeling down those tight yoga pants, but as soon as we get inside her apartment she gives me a quick, promising kiss on the lips, and tells me she wants my opinion on her new outfit. She disappears into the bedroom, leaving me tingling pleasurably with anticipation; and returns a few moments later looking like a walking wet dream. Black lace lingerie, lace-topped stockings, garter belt, high heels; it might be a cliché, but it suits her hourglass figure perfectly. The panties cup her pussy so snugly I can see the hint of a cameltoe, and have a thong back that leaves her magnificent ass cheeks exposed.
Let’s find out what else makes her ass jiggle…
I soon reach the conclusion that those panties look even better around her thighs as I bend her forward over the couch and slot my tongue inside her creamy cunt. She’s so wet I don’t waste any more time with teasing, sucking up her sweetness, licking and rubbing until any hint of nervous inhibition has dissolved under my oral onslaught and she’s moaning and mashing her soaking pussy against my face. I adore feeling a girl shake apart as I eat her out, and I have a feeling I can guess what will push her over the edge.
I pull her panties right down so she can step out of them, then spread her legs — and her cheeks — wider. I was right, she goes wild as I paint her wetness up her ass crack with my tongue, lapping at the tight pucker until I feel her entire body shivering. I press deeper, opening her up little by little. Her legs are quivering, her booty quaking delightfully against my face, and as the tip of my tongue breaches that tight ring of muscle she has one of the fiercest assgasms I’ve ever given a girl, without any significant penetration.
Her legs are too wobbly to support her after that, so I lie back and pull her onto my face, sucking on her clit as I thrust a finger all the way into her ass. It feels almost impossibly tight at first, but a string of mini orgasms courtesy of my lashing tongue makes her loosen up, and then the way she squirms and squeals as I finger-fuck her ass lets me know I’m hitting the spot. But she really goes crazy when I turn her around so she’s sitting her ass on my face in a squat position and grind my knuckles over her clit as I lick her asshole as hard and deep as I can. I’m lucky she doesn’t suffocate me as she sags down on top of me, her body jerking convulsively… although it wouldn’t be a bad way to go, surrounded by twitching girl-flesh.
As first dates go, that was pretty intense. She’s too dazed (and, I suspect, inexperienced in the ways of lady lovin’) to get me off very effectively with her tongue and fingers, so I’m still horny as I go home and make what under the circumstances I can only describe as a “booty call” to my fuck buddy Tony.
I’m stripped down to my G-string, looking at my ass in the full-length mirror in my bedroom, as he answers the phone.
“Tony, does my ass jiggle?” I ask him, in lieu of saying hello. I bounce up and down a bit on the bed, watching for the ripple effect.
“No,” he replies, “your ass is a firm little peach, baby.”
“Not even when I go on the elliptical trainer at the gym?” I ask, vaguely disappointed.
“No. By the way, you know I’m at work, right? Can we not discuss your sexy ass and all the things I’d like to do to it right now, please.”
“Not even when you bend me over and fuck me from behind?”
“No, but it jiggles when I spank it, and you’d better believe you’re going to get a good hard spanking later!” he growls, hanging up.
So now I have my second challenge of the day: can I wait until Tony gets here to spank me until my cheeks are glowing and then fuck me hard enough to make them ripple like jello?
Or…Part ten: Turned on by a sexy plan
When I finished telling Angela’s story I knew I had to go to work, so I swung my legs around my makeup stool to enjoy the sensation of his erection between my breasts for a moment.
‘Does Sue know about you and Angela?’ he asked.
‘Oh yes. I don’t keep anything from her.’ I adjusted my bra so it was more comfortable.
‘Isn’t she jealous?’
‘No… and how could she be, given she is married to Ted?’
The humour was unintentional, but Liam nearly choked all the same. ‘Wait till I tell Toby that!’
‘What about Toby?’
‘You got a problem with me telling him? He is the only person other than Sue — and you — that has never run out on me. I always tell him everything, anyway, he is the only member of my family I have left.’
On day one, Sue and I had agreed that my house would be the one place where Toby could be himself, so I knew him pretty well. ‘No, of course not… anyway, he is such a nice guy.’
Liam looked unsure for a second. ‘Have you ever let him wear your clothes?’
I checked my mascara. There was no point being anything but honest. ‘Yes I have.’ I watched him in the mirror, because I had absolutely no idea what his reaction was going to be.
‘Sue usually lets him do it the moment Ted leaves for work. It felt kinda weird at first, but hey it’s no big deal, apart from when Ted comes home unexpectedly. Man, have we had some narrow escapes.’ He thought for a moment. ‘So, if you let him dress in your clothes, have you ever had… had…’
‘Had sex with him? No. Remember, he is only just eighteen.’ I gave him a stern look. ‘And before you ask, I don’t think Sue has, either.’
‘Just curious. I never know with Sue or you. If either of you did, it would be good for him. He once told me he couldn’t imagine any woman would ever want to have sex with him. Poor guy.’
Liam sounded so completely matter of fact about his brother’s cross dressing and the whole thing seemed so problematic that I let it drop. ‘Hey, I have an idea. Grab your clothes, I want you to come into work and meet someone.’
By the time I pulled the 911 up in my parking space, Liam had done everything except read the manual and take the vehicle to pieces to see how it worked. When we got out, he announced, ‘It’s awesome, but it’s not exactly the kind of car…’ his voice trailed away.
‘…that you expect a woman to own?’ I replied, my eyes glinting.
He recovered himself. ‘Sue says you only got the first one you bought because it was more powerful than Ted’s.’
That was true. I threw a smile over my shoulder. ‘Still remember his little darling face the first time he laid eyes on it.’
‘Why don’t you like him?’
‘Why does everybody not like him? If he wasn’t so certain that he was right and everyone else was wrong, he would be a damn sight easier to get along with.’ I had lost track of how much unsolicited advice Ted had given me over the years — printed out, it would have filled many boring volumes to bursting point.
‘Who am I going to meet?’
I pressed my key fob on the car park exit door. ‘Patience. You will find out soon enough.’
As we rode the elevator I adjusted his shirt. ‘You look great. I would fuck you right here if it wasn’t for the glass walls.’
Liam was still laughing when we reached my office. I threw my bag on a chair and spread my arms. ‘Make yourself at home. Want a coffee?’ When he nodded, I pressed a button on the intercom. ‘Two coffees, one for me and another black with sugar.’
I sank into my chair. This was going to be hugely entertaining, and I could only speculate at the outcome. But outcome there would be — I knew my PA inside out.
When Angela appeared with the coffee, she looked even more cheekily innocent than she normally did, assuming such a thing was possible. She gave Liam a dazzlingly shy smile of greeting, set down our coffees, and then walked very slowly around his chair, enjoying his puzzled appreciation. Men never seem to know how to respond to her, and he was no different — despite wearing a dress that was sensationally short, she managed to radiate her usual air of tomboyish virginity and I could tell he couldn’t cope with it at all. When she was standing right behind him, her coral lips formed the word, ‘Liam?’ and when I returned an imperceptible nod, she mimed sending a text. Then she was gone, leaving a waft of perfume to linger with her memory.
Liam was wide-eyed. ‘Who was that?’ he asked, jumping to his feet as soon as the door closed. He kept staring as if willpower alone could bring her back.
I studied my nails. ‘My PA. Now, drink your coffee, and be a love, I have some work to do.’
My phone went crazy with incoming texts, so many that in the end I excused myself and walked over to Angela’s office.
Her eyes were wide. ‘Is that really Liam?’
I sat on the edge of her desk. ‘Yep.’
She came up very close, spreading my legs so that she could stand between them. ‘I want to see you having sex with him.’
This was the Angela who had me in her palm. ‘You can’t,’ I whispered. ‘You just can’t!’
Her hand slipped inside my knickers and her fingertip went unerringly for its target. ‘You don’t understand. I really really want to see you have sex with him,’ she breathed, slipping two fingers inside as my pussy went to mush.
‘It isn’t possible,’ I hissed. ‘The situation is complicated enough as it is. Besides, you don’t even like having sex with men!’ On the last point I was confident, because in the time she had been with me I had established that Angela was almost exclusively lesbian in her tastes.
Angela didn’t let her eyes drop for a second as she began to work my clit with the ball of her thumb. ‘I don’t want to have sex with him,’ she replied, withdrawing her hand the precise moment before I would have come. ‘But I want to see you do it, and if you show me, then I will do anything you want me to do.’ This despite wearing an expression as if had she had just walked out of teaching Sunday school.
‘Do you want to be in the room with us, or what?’ Her finger was back at work, rubbing my clit through my panties now, and as the two layers of material slid against each other, the feeling began to build until I could hardly think straight. I was gripping the desk and had to force the words out.
‘All I want is to see him in here, filling you, while you squirm and sweat with lust. I know you won’t fail me. I want to see him sink into you until your pussy can take no more of him and then I want you to look at me when he comes.’ She increased her speed until I gasped and came, mostly for thinking of the scene she had just conjured up. Then I knelt while she stood over me and let me service her dripping slit. Her orgasms were quiet, controlled and ladylike, and as soon as they were done, she slipped two fingers deep inside before releasing her knickers. She held them out so I could them clean. ‘Another coffee?’ she asked, with a brilliant smile, for all the world as if she was seeking approval after finishing typing her first business letter.
In the end it turned out to be easier than I could possibly have hoped. After a brief struggle with my conscience, I rationalised that we used video in training all the time at work, so why not for teaching Liam about sex? When we got back home, I changed into a plunge bra and a dress I hadn’t worn in ages and worked the conversation around to the idea.
‘Like we do our own home porno flick?’ He sounded genuinely entertained by the idea. ‘If we do, I promise there won’t be any fast forward stuff.’
I took my courage in my hands and told him I wanted to film it with a proper video camera. To be honest, I could have told him that I wanted to video us having sex on a Swiss roll and he would probably have agreed — now that I had solved his problem he was desperate to make up for lost time.
The practical side of him soon took over. ‘But who is going to film it?’
With as much matter of factness as I could muster, I replied, ‘Angela. She does all our training videos,’ which was true, for I had spent thousands sending her on endless courses on editing and lighting. I just about managed to keep my voice level, because for all her expertise, it wasn’t quite the same as filming a blue movie.
I needn’t have worried. Liam blew out his lips at the thought, and shook his head, as though he couldn’t believe his luck. ‘Is there any chance that she…?’
‘Maybe, but she isn’t really much attracted to men, darling. Besides, I want you to myself for a while.’ I stroked his hair. ‘Angela says we are going to need two or three cameras, to get all the angles, so she will have her work cut out.’
Maybe Sue’s frank accounts of her sexual experiences had paved the way, but to this Liam said no more than, ‘Why not?’ Then, ‘You have already discussed this with her?’
I realised that I had very nearly let the cat out of the bag, so I leaned over, enjoying the thirst in his eyes as he drank in my cleavage. ‘You don’t fancy her more than me, I hope?’ I asked, pressing my upper arms against my boobs to make them pop.
He spluttered, ‘No, certainly not.’
‘But you do fancy her?’
‘Well, yeah, but who wouldn’t? Are you sure she is alright with this?’ He made it sound as if his major worry was that it wouldn’t go ahead. I felt a flood of relief, mixed with the sort of urgent sexual anticipation that only Angela could create in me.
‘Leave me to talk to her, okay? She does whatever I want.’ It was the only white lie of the evening.As they walked in the room he handed her an envelope. They were coming back from dinner at a posh place in the rooftop of one of the tallest buildings in London. She looked radiant in her little black dress and high heels. It was a celebration of sorts, and the night was still young.
He had flown in early in the afternoon and as soon as they had checked into the room they were fucking like bunnies. Going for dinner had been a necessary break to gather energy and fresh air for the encore session they were about to start. She looked in his mischievous eyes and asked:
“What’s in the envelope?”
He explained that he had written a bunch of positions on a set of cards and she could use them to choose the next position in which she wanted to be shagged. He was always having these unorthodox ideas, and now she was curious. She opened it up and found a familiar set of positions written down:
Missionary on the sofa
Monkey in the bathroom sink
Doggy standing by the mirror
Flat on the belly
…
One card caught her attention. She held it in her hand and looked up at his dark chocolatey eyes:
“What is upside down spoons?”
He answered that he would be happy to show her, as a naughty smile flashed across his face. She loved that look in his eyes, and felt her inner works jump with emotion. It made her feel so wanted, and gave her goosebumps. He helped her off with her coat, and then her shoes.
He had actually helped dress her up before dinner. He liked doing that, and she knew it was a strange kink but she liked it. As she had been lying naked in bed he had gathered the clothes she had brought for the occasion. He had gotten her garter belt on first, then her black stockings. He had then wrapped her up in her short black dress, no bra. And had finished by pulling her panties up.
She liked it when he did that to her. It was a special feeling of being cared for, even if it meant that she had to help with the stockings and correct her dress as she was getting her make up done in the bathroom.
As they were walking to the restaurant she felt some of their mixed juices dripping from her. During dinner it was a constant reminder of their hard workout that afternoon.
They started kissing. Soft in the lips. Her hands busy unbuttoning his shirt. His hands pulling up her dress. She was enjoying the feeling of his warm touch on her. And his hurry to get his hands under her clothes to caress her bare skin. He pulled the zipper of her dress down and helped her out of it, as she opened his shirt and got her hands on his chest.
They also liked undressing each other. It felt as if they were unwrapping their presents. She put her hands up to help him get her out of her dress. As he pushed her dress above her boobs, she started caressing him with soft touches of her fingernails.
She fell back onto the bed as he started kissing her right nipple. She loved the way he circled its tip with his tongue, making it wet and slurping on it until it felt as if her whole boob was made out of stone. As he moved to her other breast she could also feel how he was getting rid of his shirt and trousers.
She liked to lie in bed and have him do things to her. She had told him before how she enjoyed giving up control to him. After he got her second nipple wet and hard he started cruising her body with his mouth. Discovering every inch of her, kiss by kiss. As he got to the bottom of her rib cage she felt how he was sucking harder on her. He was marking the path through her using hickeys instead of breadcrumbs.
She was still lying in bed with her hands up and her dress covering her face. In a way as if she were blindfolded, except that she could free herself at any time. She felt him going down past her belly button and proceeding to her panties.
Her panties were wet, as in extra wet. He removed them and started exploring her vulva with his mouth. He found a little concentrate of their juices at her entrance. It almost felt like candy. He got as much as he could on the tip of his tongue and moved up to kiss her. He had to move the dress above her head to place the sweet dessert he had found on her mouth. She giggled when she realized what it was. As he was freeing her from her dress she asked him:
“So what about that upside down spoons you wrote about?”
He winked at her and moved her onto her side, as if he was going to spoon her from behind. Except that he placed his head at her feet and his knees on her back. He was indeed upside down from her. He opened up one of her legs as she reached for his shaft. It only took a few strokes to have him ready to go in. She placed the tip at her entrance and he moved up her hips to place himself in position.
The visuals were fantastic. She was so wet that he slid all the way in at the first push. He was kissing her left leg and holding her by her waist. She liked seeing how his cock was moving in and out of her. He told her with a wicked smile:
“ Remember how I told you I wanted to see how you masturbate? Well, now is the time. Show me how you touch yourself when we are not together and you are missing me!”
He got her hand on top of her clit and she started her little number, with two fingertips going up and down on top of it. He was moving slowly in and out, as she reached to his shaft to get some of their juices on her fingertips. Her fingers continued the dancing routine, except that the intimate atmosphere had now been replaced by the voyeurism of feeling his stare on her.
This felt so extremely hot to him. He could see in her face what she was experiencing. Every now and then she flashed a smile at him and looked in his eyes. She still had her stockings and garter belt on, and the view of her fantastic body from his vantage point was something out of this world. He could see in her expression how she was concentrating on her orgasm.
Her fingers were doing the final strokes and she knew she would be over the edge soon. The slow in and out dance was helping her build up. She opened her mouth to tell him:
“I am about to come…”
And with a few more caresses she arched her back and released the next batch of energy. He parked his cock all the way inside of her and could feel her shaking surrounding him. He was looking at her, as a spectator who has been given access to a very private show. A show built up of their love, of their want of each other, and from the build up of the days that they had not been together.
They agreed that these are the moments worth living for.Don’t speak to me with words
Talk with lips on skin
Scream with fingers on my back
Send your messageWhen it came to anal stuff she was a virgin. He had not pushed for it because it was not a kink that he was particularly looking for. However he knew from experience that there were girls who really, really liked it. So as they were cuddling in bed he brought the topic up. She was curious but since she did not know what to expect she was in no hurry to try it.
He was giving her oral pleasure, his tongue making pirouettes together with her clit, her labia being their dancefloor. She had her legs on his shoulders and was enjoying the slow and steady build up of energy down there. He had one hand by her butt crack, and the fingers of the other one were caressing the outside of her vulva.
He placed his finger at her entrance. She was relaxed and welcoming the visitor. She moved her hips to accommodate a better angle and his finger just slid inside of her. He felt her cushioned inside, which was extremely wet. He moved his index finger all the way in, but it was not enough. His middle finger came to the rescue and both made it as deep as they could get.
His tongue was concentrating on her clit as he looked up at her. She was observing him with a look of pleasure in her eyes. He paused and asked her:
“Do you want me to try through the back door?”
“If you want…” was her answer. After the long loving session her labia were so engorged that he knew she would probably be quite receptive to his finger. He moved his fingers out and placed the tip of the index one at her back entrance. He started playfully drilling in with a circular motion as she started moving her hips to accommodate this new sensation.
After a few strokes the finger made it all the way inside. He kept stroking as her moaning increased. He was focusing on her clit again and could feel that her emotions were about to overflow. His whole mouth was covering her pearl and he was sucking firmly. Suddenly the walls of her thighs came tumbling down with a roar.
He had brought some avocado oil-based organic lube for them to experiment with. She was now riding him on top. They had melted together again and did not know where one ended and the other started. During one of her motions away, his shaft came out of her. She flashed a mischievous look at him and grabbed his manhood with her hand, while the other one reached for the lube.
She got enough liquid on him and started stroking his cock. It was thick, but she really wanted to try to fit him inside through the back door. She guided the tip in place and started pushing down. It was a new feeling. His finger had just slid inside without much effort, but this thing was major work.
She placed her hands on his pelvis and closed her eyes as she started pushing down in little steps. Her nerves down there were in overdrive as she could feel a bit of a pang with every push. Slowly she made way for him; the deeper it got, the easier it became.
He was looking at her beautiful figure on top of him. Her face framed by her beautiful hair. Her breasts like two flowers in full bloom. His hands on her hips, trying to provide her with some support. She opened her eyes to look at him, and he could feel her internal emotion in her expression.
She moved down to place a kiss on his mouth, and told him:
“Here you go, my anal virginity, a present for you!”2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.

I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.
Follow MyErotica for refined erotic fiction to ignite your deepest desires.Shallow breaths
As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
HeThe first time, I was pretty sure I was seeing things. I was in my towel, fresh out the shower, ready to pick my undies before heading out for my uni class in town. Deciding what to wear, I had this vague, mostly subconscious sense that my bras and panties weren’t quite laid out how they were the previous morning.
The second time, I was convinced someone had been in my panty drawer. Some of my panties and thongs we definitely not arranged how I’d left them.
I felt pissed. Which of my housemates was going through my personal stuff? There were five of us living together. Two girls, three guys. None of them seemed the sort who’d go through my lingerie. Then again: how would I know?
The third time I caught him. Sat on my bed, with my favorite black lace panties wrapped around his cock. He was pumping himself hard and fast.
“What the fuck, James?” I said angrily, turning on the light.
“Shit,” was all he managed. And then again: “Shit.”
I’ve never seen anyone look so panicked. Deer in the headlights didn’t come close to it.
He took my panties off his cock, left them on my bed, and zipped himself back up. Then, unable to look me in the eyes, he walked straight past me, head down, and up to his top floor bedroom.
Two hours later I was lying in bed, unable to sleep.
The anger had subsided. Bizarrely, the initial feelings of violation had now turned to intrigue.
I’d never thought of any of my housemates as anything but friends. And now suddenly I couldn’t help but think about James differently.
He was into me.
My thoughts lingered for a moment on seeing his cock.
Out of nowhere, I felt a slight shudder of pleasure go through me thinking about my sexiest panties wrapped around it. Without even realizing, my hand had slipped down between my legs.
What was I thinking? I was shocked at myself. I wanted to feel angry again. That was the normal response I should be having. Right? But I couldn’t get the anger back. Suddenly the whole thing felt thrilling.
Before I could stop myself, I picked up my phone. And I texted him.
“Next time, just ask, okay?”
My heart was racing. What was I doing? I felt instant regret.
Then I heard my phone beep.
“Next time?”
Out of nowhere I felt this longing to see his cock again. With my panties wrapped around it. I wanted to watch him do it.
“How about now?” I wrote impulsively.
“?” he replied instantly.
Did I really want to do this? What was I getting myself into?
Fuck it, I thought.
“Come down and play with my panties again…while I watch,” I texted.
My left hand was rubbing my clit through my panties as I typed on the phone with my right. I hadn’t felt turned on like this in ages. Maybe never quite like this.
My phone beeped again.
“Are you serious?”
I found myself getting almost annoyed at his hesitancy, firing off an instant reply.
“Yes! Now get the fuck down here already.”
I heard the floorboards creak. His room was directly above mine. And then his slow footsteps down the stairs. He knocked gently on my door. Walked in, smiling sheepishly.
He didn’t know what to say.
“I want to watch you jerk off in my panties,” I told him, suddenly feeling bold in a way that surprised me.
I lifted the bedcover off and moved so I was sitting on top of it instead. I indicated for him to come and sit next to me. He was still fully dressed and clearly nervous. I found it quite endearing. And it made me want to take charge like I never had before.
“Take your jeans and boxers off,” I told him.
He could hardly look at me, but did it immediately. I smiled when I saw his cock. So big and hard. Maybe he was nervous, but he was as turned on as I was.
“Now take my panties off for me.”
He looked at me, stunned. I could tell he was about to come out with this ‘are you serious’ line again, so I didn’t let him.
“Yes, I’m serious. Take them off. I want you to use these when you jerk off.”
I knelt up. He moved towards me. He slid his hands up the outside of my thighs, under my short nightdress, and up to my black panties. Yes, the ones I’d caught him playing with before.
Feeling his hands on me was mesmerizing. It was tempting to just have sex. But I was determined to watch him play with himself in my panties.
He peeled my panties off me. Instinctively he moved them straight to his face. I totally got off on watching him sniff my panties. I’d never even thought about anything like this and now it was driving my imagination wild.
Then he took my panties and, while looking into my eyes, wrapped them around his oh-so-delicious looking cock.
Instantly he let out a quiet moan as he touched himself for the first time.
I felt so wet that I was sure I was dripping.
I watched him rub himself slowly with my panties. I wasn’t even sure why this was such a turn on. But it was.
I sat on my bed, back to the wall, and parted my legs. I began to play with myself as he sat on the side of my bed rubbing himself harder and faster.
When he turned and saw me, his eyes widened.
“Fuuuucck,” I heard him whisper.
I could tell he was about to come soon.
I was desperate to see him come all over my panties. I don’t even know why. But I wanted it so badly. Needed it.
And then he did.
His body convulsed in front of me. And I watched as he came, covering my panties. I felt myself getting close to my own orgasm now too.
Another thought flashed into my mind.
“Lick my panties,” I told him. “I want to watch you lick your own cum out of my panties.”
James was so turned on he would have done anything.
And he did.
I watched him lick my panties, feeling more aroused than ever in my life.
“Now come and lick me.”
He didn’t hesitate. He lay between my legs, and moved his mouth to my pussy. I grabbed his head, pulling him tight towards me.
It didn’t take long. I was ready. Barely a minute after his tongue moved around my clit, I was ready to explode.
I squirted all over his face.
I’d never squirted before.I expect my Master soon
and knowing His pleasures, I must
prepare myself for His arrival.
I see myself reflected,
corsetted tight and waist nipped in
black, the way He wants me.
I look to check that
seams are straight and too high heels that
thrust my body into provocation.
I scent the room and
light soft candles, making shadows play upon
the body that will be His to use.
I find His ballgag and
part my lips to take it deep, and tighten the strap
so my cheeks bulge with violation.
I ensure His whip is hanging
where He may reach it when need arouses
and mark me in ways He pleases.
I caress the steel of cuffs
between my fingers, wanting to see them
glittering against yielding skin.
I feel compulsion in His iron bed
that will welcome my spread-eagled body
each shackle open with invitation.
I reach down to encircle ankles
to hear the sound of metal closing
moistening me wide for surrender.
I strain above my head to reach the bars
stretched tight is the way He wants me, I must
tighten steel upon my wrists.
I am here for Him now
knowing not when He will come, only that desire
will grow with the waiting.
I can only stare upwards
knowing that when He comes,
I will be only His.
101 Poems for kinky lovers, by Francesca Anderssen is available in paperback and on the Amazon kindle marketplace.Take me as your very own
tie me as your love demands
use me now and use me fully
force me down to your commands
I need to know your chains upon me
such craving there will always be
to want your ropes to hurt my body
so your bonds will set me free
Submission is my total needing
wanting you to make it so
taking me to places strangely
where I cannot help but go
You’re the one who now must hold me
I’ve sold myself to your control
with my freedom gone forever
now that you possess my soul
So tie me tighter yet and tighter
my screams must bite the gag you give
use my mind to make me suffer
this is how I want to live.

Mimi Bordeaux
Nov 7, 2016
Audrey is sitting in a cocktail lounge. She’s sipping her Cosmo, thinking to herself, ‘I deserve a night out. I work hard. It will be nice to enjoy a few drinks.’ She’s happy with her attire and looks elegant. She’s wearing a little black dress with a strand of pearls and her hair is tied up in a French roll.
A plain looking girl enters the bar. She never goes to bars but tonight she’s decided to be adventurous as it’s a warm summer evening. As she walks in she looks around nervously for an empty table. She is thinking, ‘I want to have an encounter… with anyone.’ She has never been in a proper relationship and at 26 she thinks it’s time.
She’s ordering her drink at the bar — a Shirley Temple — when she notices the elegant woman sitting there. Audrey is lost in her own thoughts, but her interest is piqued by Jane’s request for the non-alcoholic drink. She swings her bar stool around to look at her.
Jane summons up the courage to blurt out, “Oh hello… do you come here often?” She feels like a fool for her clichéd opening gambit, but she continues anyway. “I don’t usually go to bars, but here I am.”
Audrey coolly replies, “I like to go out alone and have a few drinks by myself.” She looks Jane up and down, notices that she’s actually rather sweet looking despite her plain clothes, senses her air of barely contained excitement. Her tone becomes warmer. “It’s quite dull here actually. How about you come back to my place and tell me all about yourself?”
“There’s not much to tell,” Jane says nervously, but before she really knows what’s happening she’s agreed to go back to Audrey’s place anyway.
It’s not far by taxi to Audrey’s luxurious apartment. ‘Oh, this is exciting!’ Jane thinks to herself. She still lives with her mother in an ordinary suburban house. Audrey offers her a drink and tells her to make herself comfortable, while she gets changed. She disappears through the double doors leading to her bedroom. Jane looks around; she’s never seen such opulence and she thinks Audrey must be very worldly.
Audrey returns. She has been busy putting on her outfit. She stands there, imposing, looking even taller in fishnet stockings and thigh high leather boots with spike heels. Her black corset barely contains her voluptuous breasts. She is wearing a dog collar around her neck and a black leather mask. She holds a black whip which she flicks every second.
She stares at Jane and says, “Go through that door,” gesturing towards a red leather door off the bedroom with the whip. Jane’s heart is racing. She’s apprehensive but excited by Audrey’s domineering tone. She does as she’s told and enters the room with Audrey following, flicking the whip at her behind. First softly, then a hard crack that stings Jane’s buttocks.
Jane perches on a stool in the middle of the room, the only place to sit, and glances around at her surroundings. Chains, ropes and leather straps hang from the ceiling and walls. She shivers at the sight.
Audrey slams the door shut and barks, “Did I give you permission to sit down?” Jane is confused. Audrey walks toward her, flicking the whip, and stands over her. “Open your legs.” Jane does as she’s told. “Are you getting wet? You must be excited.” Jane squirms, feeling wetness between the tops of her thighs. She’s never felt this way before. There’s a tingling sensation she can’t fathom. It’s because of Audrey.
Jane looks up. Audrey is staring at her and in a second has Jane’s head in her hands. She swipes her tongue up Jane’s cheek then to her mouth, biting hard on the lower lip. She rolls her tongue around Jane’s lips and forcefully enters her mouth, her tongue pushing in deep, grabbing onto Jane’s tongue with her teeth.
Audrey kneels, pulls Jane’s skirt and panties off and moves her head between Jane’s legs. Jane is quivering and needs to hold onto something but there’s nothing except Audrey. She puts her hands on Audrey’s head, winds her fingers into the elegantly coiffured hair. Audrey licks all the way from Jane’s asshole to her clit. She sticks her tongue in Jane’s cunt. In out, in out. She does it over and over again, licking Jane’s whole crack and tongue-fucking her deeper and deeper. Then she focuses on Jane’s clit, licking more softly.
Jane is overwhelmed by the attention and instinctively opens her legs wider. Audrey sucks and nibbles on her swollen clit, licking voraciously. Jane’s head is swimming, she thinks she may faint and her legs are trembling uncontrollably. There’s a fluttering in her stomach like an eel spinning around. She’s sweating, her chest is burning and her face is flushed. She’s on the verge of something, a sensation she’s never felt before. It’s building up from her toes, up her legs; between them she feels a gush of fluid. Suddenly she throws her head back, straining, her eyes tight shut; she grabs Audrey’s head and makes a high-pitched involuntary screech. She can’t think, see or hear any more, but she’s screaming out her pleasure as she slides off the stool.
“Shut up!” Audrey says harshly, pulling her to her feet and leading her by the neck to some ropes hanging from the ceiling. She ties Jane’s hands tightly and tells her to bend over. Jane is giddy, but she does as she’s told. There’s a sound behind her, then she feels something touching her cunt. It thrusts inside her, going right to the hilt, then out again. It goes in again and starts to move slowly, in out, in out. Jane moans as the thrusting becomes more intense.
Now it’s moving more quickly, sending waves of heat up Jane’s body. She moans and whispers, “Yes… oh yes!” as Audrey pumps her cunt with force. Audrey slams the dildo in, pressing at a special spot that has Jane intoxicated. Jane can’t hold back any longer and yells out, clutching at the rope, sweat dripping from her forehead, her cunt soaking wet and squirting juices that dribble down her thighs.
Audrey turns Jane around and thrusts the dildo into her mouth, making her gag for a moment before she adjusts to its size. “Suck!” says Audrey sternly. The dildo is coated with cum and Jane tastes her own juice for the first time.
Audrey unties Jane’s wrists and buckles a dog collar around her neck, with a short leash attached. She leads her to a wooden table. “Bend over and put your ass in the air, slut,” she commands her. The words have an instant effect on Jane, who feels her cunt swell and throb, more wetness trickling down her thighs. She’s so turned on.
Audrey holds onto the leash and rubs her finger against Jane’s asshole. Jane feels something cold and sticky being spread over her, and then Audrey’s fingertip wriggling into her ass. It feels strange, but good. The finger goes a little deeper, and then suddenly thrusts all the way inside. She yells.
“Shut up, slut,” Audrey says, adding a second finger and pumping them in and out of Jane’s ass. Jane lies flat against the table, ass up, and takes it. She starts to like it. She moans with each stroke.
“You like that do you, my little slut?” Audrey says, going deeper and faster. Jane is dizzy with excitement, growling and howling. Her orgasm fires through her whole body, radiating out from her core.
After a few minutes Audrey withdraws her fingers and Jane slumps down onto the table, exhausted. Audrey grabs the leash, making Jane stand, then removes the collar. She stares at Jane. She grabs her head and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck, then kisses her on the mouth.
“Time for you to go home,” she says. “You know the way out.” She marches Jane to the red door and pushes her through it, throwing her clothes after her. Jane dresses rapidly and staggers to the front door. Her pussy and ass are throbbing as she runs down the stairs. She’s floating. She feels like a bird in flight. She begins to walk.This girl looks exactly like me. The same long, wavy blonde hair. The same blue-grey eyes, the sprinkling of freckles over the bridge of her nose. The same slender fingers, moving to my nipple, as mine move to hers. We could be twins.
Only the tattoo on my back and the one on her foot mark us apart. She laughs when she undresses me and sees mine.
“Maybe I need to get one like it,” she says, getting down on her knees to kiss it, lick it; her tongue moving lower, down the cleft of my ass.
We met earlier that night, in a bar.
Coming face to face, I think for a moment that I’m walking into a mirror. We stare at each other for a long while, fascinated.
Before long we’ve both ditched our dates and are huddled in a corner, insulated from the noise of the bar by our absorption in each other. We’re drunk on the sight of each other, cataloguing the myriad points on which we are the same and the few tiny differences, obsessively.
“You’re just like me,” we keep telling each other.
When she asks my name and I say, ‘Narcisse,’ she laughs delightedly, getting the reference at once: Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection and died for love of himself.
She tells me hers is ‘Belle,’ which I know means beautiful; I’m not sure whether or not she’s lying but I like the inference, so I call her Belle anyway.
A little later and we’re sitting so close she’s practically on my lap, kissing avidly.
“Bet you’d fuck yourself if you could, wouldn’t you?” she says.
“Of course I would. Wouldn’t you?” She nods, unabashed. “Want to find out what it feels like?”
She nods again, runs a fingertip up my thigh as she leans in to whisper, “Your place or mine?”
My place then, the bedroom lights blazing so we can see every minute detail of each other as we undress, touch, explore. Every inch of her body looks strangely familiar. I lick each smooth expanse of skin as I uncover it, mapping the territory as I go, noting each hair and freckle. She shivers with arousal as I kiss her neck and then on downward, cupping a breast and sucking the nipple; she moans and I feel it harden against my tongue. Her responsiveness pleases me and my own nipples stiffen in sympathy, as if what I’m doing to her is physically mirrored in my own trembling flesh. I suck harder, my hands encircling her waist and running down over her hips.
I kiss and lick my way down her taut stomach, feeling it ripple at my light touch, then slide her panties down to her thighs and gaze at her pussy, enthralled. A neat tuft of blonde curls crowns her smooth, plump-lipped cunt. It’s like looking at myself from an angle I’ve never experienced before. I stare and stare until the intensity makes her fidget and she breaks the spell by pulling me onto the bed, breathless and flushed.
“What do you like?” she asks; meaning: how shall I get you off?
“You know what I like,” I reply, meaning: we’re the same. I like what you like.
Turns out I’m both right and wrong. She starts out gentle and teasing, kissing and licking around the edge of my skimpy panties, sucking my inner thigh, then licking me through the thin fabric until I’m dripping. By the time she peels my panties off and skims a fingertip along the slippery groove between my lips, I’m fighting the urge to tell her faster, harder, fuck me now! But it seems the teasing is what I wanted after all. Her touch is insistent, hypnotic, a slow build to a long drawn-out orgasm that has me screaming when she finally lets me come with three fingers plunging into my drenched hole and her lips suctioned around my clit.
I roll her onto her back and straddle her, kissing her insatiably, licking my cream from her lips. Pulling back to look into her eyes, I’m giddy with lust. For one vertiginous moment I feel as if I’m falling into a mirror, fucking myself into insanity.
Now all I can think about is tasting her. I spin around into a sixty-nine so I can hover my pussy over her face, too sensitive from my orgasm for much contact but shivering with arousal as she flicks her tongue delicately over my folds. My approach is more direct, more brutal; she’s shown me how she likes to be touched and now I’m teaching her my way. Spreading her open with my fingers, I swipe my tongue across her clit, over and over, relentless. My elbows pin her knees apart, my weight pinioning her so however much she squirms, she can’t escape the overpowering sensations. When she’s moaning and babbling deliriously, her hips juddering as she tries to hump up against my tongue, I thrust two fingers from each hand inside her, stretching her open and curling them to seek out her G-spot. Her hips buck so hard she nearly throws me off her as she comes, soaking my hands. She tastes just like me and that thought, coupled with the way she sucks fiercely at my cunt as she loses it, makes me come again.
We lie facing each other, and gaze into each other’s eyes, absorbing this information, the new things we’ve learned about ourselves from each other.
“I never knew I could come like that,” she says, wonderingly.
“I never knew I liked to be teased so much,” I laugh. She reaches for me again, kissing me hard as she slides one leg between my thighs, hooking the other over my hip. A little shuffling and we’re grinding together, pussy to pussy, both so hot and wet. There’s just enough friction to drive me out of my mind, my clit throbbing as I rub against her, hips moving in tight circles. This time, coming feels like hurtling down a long, dark tunnel into an explosion of light. I don’t know if the hammering against my chest is her heart or mine. The sense of consummation is profound.
We’ve been kissing and fingering, licking and sucking and fucking each other for so many hours it’s daylight when we finally disengage, blissed out and exhausted.
“Can I see you again,” she asks.
“You’ll see me every time you look in the mirror,” I reply.Watching your wife get fucked by another man is a real thrill, there is no doubt about that. But there are some cucks who want to take it even further. How can you go further than fucking? Cucks like me, we don’t just want our wives to cheat on us with their bodies. What we long for, more than anything else, is for our wives to develop real feelings for the bull.
It is called emotional cuckoldry. And it is not for the faint of heart. It is for people who are willing to really test their own inner strength. Maybe you suspect that it would be nice to watch your wife falling for another. I mean, it brings the excitement of competition to the surface, after all. But then, your heart gets kind of stamped on as she reveals to you the truth — that not only does he have a bigger cock than you, but he has also managed to awaken a real heart connection in her. Yes, that’s exciting too. But it is also incredibly scary. It means she might leave you.
And this is the real juice.
We emotional cuckolds must have had some abandonment issues in the past. And this fear of abandonment somehow is fused in our psyche with eroticism. So when the idea that our wife might leave first presents itself, the lump we feel in our throat is like nothing else. It unearths a desire and an excitement in us that is reckless — almost unlawful. Certainly taboo. We are not supposed to enjoy this. We must be masochistic, though, because we do. It hurts so good. So good.
It first happened to me with Ben, a guy that my wife had started fooling around with at work.
I knew she had a crush on him, that much she had confessed to me. But she hadn’t told me any of the details. I had assured her it was OK for her to pursue this crush, but she didn’t trust me, I guess. But finally, we had a date night, planned a week in advance, and I was able to get some of the details out of her.
It was dinner at The Corner Place, our favorite casual but awesome Italian. I waited until we had both ordered and had sipped a little red wine. Then I hit her with it.
“So, Lexy,” I said. “I’ve known you for a long time. You know, three years before we even started dating. Three years of dating. One year of marriage. That’s seven years.”
“Uh huh. Good math skills.”
She’s funny, I’ll give her that.
“I know you honey,” I said. “You can’t, you know…”
“I can’t what?”
“Well, I know you. And I would know if you weren’t, you know, telling me everything…”
“Oh, can we not talk about Ben tonight,” she said. “Can we just have a date night, me and you. Without Ben.”
“Of course.”
Shut down.
She shut me right down. Now I had to sit with these feelings. She was totally cheating on me. I mean, I knew she was cheating on me. But even this, being totally cheated on by the person who was cheating on me, by her withholding the details. Even this, I loved it.
It was a tortuous but lovely feeling.
We got through the whole date night. Got in bed, and I started making love to her. And as I was going down on her, I said, “Mmm, this tastes so good.” And then I just coyly asked her, “Has Ben tasted how good this tastes?”
“Mmmhmmm,” she murmured.
“I’m sorry,” I said, between licks of her clit. “Was that a yes?”
“Mmmmhmm,” she said.
“When did the lucky boy taste that?” I said, coming up for air.
“A couple days ago,” she gasped; she was almost ready to climax now. “We went back to his apartment at lunch. He wanted to fuck me. But I couldn’t.”
“So he just ate you,” I said.
“Mmmhmmm.”
“Did you cum?”
“Mmmhmmm.”
“And…”
“Oh shut up, I’m going to cum!”
And I concentrated on my work and made her cum real well. Then she went down and started reciprocating on my cock.
“Ah, and has Ben been as lucky as me in this regard?” I asked.
“Oh Jesus,” she said. “I’m trying to suck a dick here. Are you going to interrogate me or do you want a blow job?”
“Just nod or shake your head. Have you sucked his dick?”
She nodded.
I felt so good then. We were complete again. We weren’t holding anything back.
“Was it a nice dick?”
She shrugged her shoulders, then she nodded. I guessed it was a pretty nice dick.
“Bigger or smaller than mine?”
She made a kind of sing-songy noise. I didn’t hear it at first. But when she repeated it, I took her to be sing-songing “a little bigger.”
“A little bigger?”
She nodded.
“That’s good. That’s very good.”
It was so good in fact that I shot my load right then.
She was pissed.
“Josh!” she said. “I wanted to get fucked! I really wanted you to fuck me on our date night. Damn it.”
She got in bed next to me. But she wasn’t the one who should be pissed. It was her fault. She’d never told me this. And then, to find it out this way, through my subterfuge, it was all so exciting, I couldn’t help myself when I finally saw her nodding and admitting to a blow job. I just came like crazy.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” I said, finally asking the question that had been hanging between us.
“I’m sorry honey,” she said. “I just…I just didn’t feel like…you know, going through the details…I wanted it to be something…private, between me and Ben. Just this one private thing. I mean, I think that’s all it’s ever going to be. I don’t think I can bring myself to fuck him. So he ate my pussy and he made me cum and I sucked his cock and I made him cum, but–”
“Did he cum in your mouth?”
“See,” she said.
“See what?”
“This! I mean, I thought we could do this, Josh. I thought you could be…cooler about it. But maybe you can’t…handle it, I don’t know. I am going to call the whole thing off.”
“No! I can handle it!” I panicked. I was anxious that she was going to call the whole thing off. That was the last thing I wanted. “I don’t want you to call it off.”
It was then that she just broke down crying like crazy. I thought it was all my fault.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” I said to her. But through her blubbering, I gathered that it wasn’t my fault.
“What is it, then?” I asked.
“Oh, Josh,” she said. “I am so sorry. But…I think I’m falling in love with him. I’m sorry!”
“In love with Ben?”
“Yes,” she cried. “I’ve had a crush on him for months, yes. But now that we have been fooling around, Josh, I feel different with him, to how I feel with you. I’m so sorry. I feel…in my heart for him, something that I guess I didn’t know was there. But I think that’s what you’re supposed to feel in your heart for someone you fuck. I guess I shouldn’t have married you because I don’t feel that in my heart for you. I am so sorry. Oh God, I am so sorry about this. But it’s been driving me crazy and I’ve just got to be honest and tell you.”
“Tell me what?” I asked.
“I don’t love you, Josh,” she said, through a river of tears. “I’m sorry, I just don’t!”
When I woke up, she was packing a bag.
“What?” I said. “What are you doing?”
“What do you think I’m doing? Did you not hear what I told you last night? Were you drunk?”
“No,” I said. “I heard everything.”
“Then you know, that’s why I’m packing. I don’t love you, Josh. I’ve got to move out.”
“No you don’t,” I said. “That’s the last thing I want.”
“Right. You want to be married to someone who doesn’t love you? How fucked up is that?”
“Well, you might think it’s fucked up,” I said. “But Lexy, you know…it’s perfect for me. In so many ways. I mean, you know my upbringing…you know what I’m used to. My family didn’t love me. They didn’t even want me. So this is exactly what I’m comfortable with. I am just glad that it’s finally out in the open. I mean, you don’t think I knew that you didn’t love me? I mean, on our wedding day you were practically making out with Srivanda out on the balcony. I saw that, you know? The reason I picked you, unconsciously or consciously, must be because I have never felt loved and I wanted to continue that with my adult family.”
“So you want to stay with me, even though I don’t love you?”
She looked at me in disbelief.
“Yes,” I cried. “I love you more than ever now. This is what I want. Unrequited love. I want to suffer. I love it.”
“You love it.”
“Oh my God, if I could somehow let you experience what I experienced last night when you confessed this all to me. If you had been able to feel my chest, the compressions there. It was so intense. And then the back of my throat. It was such a pressure. And in my balls and my cock. I started almost cumming in my pants as you detailed how much you had been faking it, and how you really didn’t love me at all. It was so intense. It was painful and for some reason, the most pleasant feeling I have ever felt. After you went to sleep last night I went to the bathroom and I beat off ten times, I was so horny. Looking at you now, I think I’m going to cum again, just seeing your loveliness, and knowing that you don’t want me — it gives you an unbelievable power, don’t you see. You’ve become…Cleopatra. Royal. Beautiful beyond belief. You’ve become divine. A Goddess I can serve, but never equal. You’ve become…my dream come true.”
She looked at me like I was totally out of my mind.
“Wow, she said. “I did not…expect that.”
She put down her bags.
“So you want me to stay?”
“Yes!” I said. “Please stay.”
“Alright,” she said, looking bewildered. “I’ll stay. For now anyhow.”
And that’s how I became an emotional cuckold. My wife didn’t tell me details about her sex with her boyfriend any more. She shared details about her emotional connection with him. How he made her feel all girlie and excited. She took me shopping when she wanted to buy him a special gift. She wrote me emails and even handwritten letters about what a crush she had on him, how sexy he was, and how wonderful and special a person he was. She drew little hearts. She put her name and his name inside the heart. She took loads of special selfies of the two of them hugging and she sent them all to me. She shared herself and her affair with me totally. Even more than totally. I had the feeling that she was exaggerating a lot of it just because she understood me so perfectly. She knew that the worse she made it for me, the more jealous and shut out I felt, the more excited I got. And she took me there. All the way. She gave me the ultimate thrill. She made me into an emotional cuckold.
My wife. I love her so!I’m walking behind this girl in skintight yoga pants as she leaves the gym, watching her ass shimmy with every step she takes. I’m so mesmerized by the ripple effect that I barely even notice where I’m going. Does my ass jiggle like that when I walk? I can hardly grab it in the street to find out, but it doesn’t feel like it does. Now I’d like to grab her ass and feel her flesh bounce and shake as she sits on my face…
She goes into a coffee shop, and I follow, suddenly seized by a craving for caffeine (and pussy). She sits at a table by the window, catches my eye and smiles invitingly. I’m surprised I don’t recognize her — I thought I knew all the hot girls at my gym — but when I ask if I can join her, the effusive response makes it clear she’s noticed me before.
The morning’s progression is no less enjoyable for being entirely predictable. I’m in my comfort zone here, seducing cute girls being one of my favorite pastimes. Another coffee? Flirtatious chat. Her hand brushes my thigh as she leans across me to reach for the sugar, and she lets it linger there for a moment. Lunch? She lives nearby, she could make us something to eat…
I’ve been looking forward to peeling down those tight yoga pants, but as soon as we get inside her apartment she gives me a quick, promising kiss on the lips, and tells me she wants my opinion on her new outfit. She disappears into the bedroom, leaving me tingling pleasurably with anticipation; and returns a few moments later looking like a walking wet dream. Black lace lingerie, lace-topped stockings, garter belt, high heels; it might be a cliché, but it suits her hourglass figure perfectly. The panties cup her pussy so snugly I can see the hint of a cameltoe, and have a thong back that leaves her magnificent ass cheeks exposed.
Let’s find out what else makes her ass jiggle…
I soon reach the conclusion that those panties look even better around her thighs as I bend her forward over the couch and slot my tongue inside her creamy cunt. She’s so wet I don’t waste any more time with teasing, sucking up her sweetness, licking and rubbing until any hint of nervous inhibition has dissolved under my oral onslaught and she’s moaning and mashing her soaking pussy against my face. I adore feeling a girl shake apart as I eat her out, and I have a feeling I can guess what will push her over the edge.
I pull her panties right down so she can step out of them, then spread her legs — and her cheeks — wider. I was right, she goes wild as I paint her wetness up her ass crack with my tongue, lapping at the tight pucker until I feel her entire body shivering. I press deeper, opening her up little by little. Her legs are quivering, her booty quaking delightfully against my face, and as the tip of my tongue breaches that tight ring of muscle she has one of the fiercest assgasms I’ve ever given a girl, without any significant penetration.
Her legs are too wobbly to support her after that, so I lie back and pull her onto my face, sucking on her clit as I thrust a finger all the way into her ass. It feels almost impossibly tight at first, but a string of mini orgasms courtesy of my lashing tongue makes her loosen up, and then the way she squirms and squeals as I finger-fuck her ass lets me know I’m hitting the spot. But she really goes crazy when I turn her around so she’s sitting her ass on my face in a squat position and grind my knuckles over her clit as I lick her asshole as hard and deep as I can. I’m lucky she doesn’t suffocate me as she sags down on top of me, her body jerking convulsively… although it wouldn’t be a bad way to go, surrounded by twitching girl-flesh.
As first dates go, that was pretty intense. She’s too dazed (and, I suspect, inexperienced in the ways of lady lovin’) to get me off very effectively with her tongue and fingers, so I’m still horny as I go home and make what under the circumstances I can only describe as a “booty call” to my fuck buddy Tony.
I’m stripped down to my G-string, looking at my ass in the full-length mirror in my bedroom, as he answers the phone.
“Tony, does my ass jiggle?” I ask him, in lieu of saying hello. I bounce up and down a bit on the bed, watching for the ripple effect.
“No,” he replies, “your ass is a firm little peach, baby.”
“Not even when I go on the elliptical trainer at the gym?” I ask, vaguely disappointed.
“No. By the way, you know I’m at work, right? Can we not discuss your sexy ass and all the things I’d like to do to it right now, please.”
“Not even when you bend me over and fuck me from behind?”
“No, but it jiggles when I spank it, and you’d better believe you’re going to get a good hard spanking later!” he growls, hanging up.
So now I have my second challenge of the day: can I wait until Tony gets here to spank me until my cheeks are glowing and then fuck me hard enough to make them ripple like jello?
Or…Part ten: Turned on by a sexy plan
When I finished telling Angela’s story I knew I had to go to work, so I swung my legs around my makeup stool to enjoy the sensation of his erection between my breasts for a moment.
‘Does Sue know about you and Angela?’ he asked.
‘Oh yes. I don’t keep anything from her.’ I adjusted my bra so it was more comfortable.
‘Isn’t she jealous?’
‘No… and how could she be, given she is married to Ted?’
The humour was unintentional, but Liam nearly choked all the same. ‘Wait till I tell Toby that!’
‘What about Toby?’
‘You got a problem with me telling him? He is the only person other than Sue — and you — that has never run out on me. I always tell him everything, anyway, he is the only member of my family I have left.’
On day one, Sue and I had agreed that my house would be the one place where Toby could be himself, so I knew him pretty well. ‘No, of course not… anyway, he is such a nice guy.’
Liam looked unsure for a second. ‘Have you ever let him wear your clothes?’
I checked my mascara. There was no point being anything but honest. ‘Yes I have.’ I watched him in the mirror, because I had absolutely no idea what his reaction was going to be.
‘Sue usually lets him do it the moment Ted leaves for work. It felt kinda weird at first, but hey it’s no big deal, apart from when Ted comes home unexpectedly. Man, have we had some narrow escapes.’ He thought for a moment. ‘So, if you let him dress in your clothes, have you ever had… had…’
‘Had sex with him? No. Remember, he is only just eighteen.’ I gave him a stern look. ‘And before you ask, I don’t think Sue has, either.’
‘Just curious. I never know with Sue or you. If either of you did, it would be good for him. He once told me he couldn’t imagine any woman would ever want to have sex with him. Poor guy.’
Liam sounded so completely matter of fact about his brother’s cross dressing and the whole thing seemed so problematic that I let it drop. ‘Hey, I have an idea. Grab your clothes, I want you to come into work and meet someone.’
By the time I pulled the 911 up in my parking space, Liam had done everything except read the manual and take the vehicle to pieces to see how it worked. When we got out, he announced, ‘It’s awesome, but it’s not exactly the kind of car…’ his voice trailed away.
‘…that you expect a woman to own?’ I replied, my eyes glinting.
He recovered himself. ‘Sue says you only got the first one you bought because it was more powerful than Ted’s.’
That was true. I threw a smile over my shoulder. ‘Still remember his little darling face the first time he laid eyes on it.’
‘Why don’t you like him?’
‘Why does everybody not like him? If he wasn’t so certain that he was right and everyone else was wrong, he would be a damn sight easier to get along with.’ I had lost track of how much unsolicited advice Ted had given me over the years — printed out, it would have filled many boring volumes to bursting point.
‘Who am I going to meet?’
I pressed my key fob on the car park exit door. ‘Patience. You will find out soon enough.’
As we rode the elevator I adjusted his shirt. ‘You look great. I would fuck you right here if it wasn’t for the glass walls.’
Liam was still laughing when we reached my office. I threw my bag on a chair and spread my arms. ‘Make yourself at home. Want a coffee?’ When he nodded, I pressed a button on the intercom. ‘Two coffees, one for me and another black with sugar.’
I sank into my chair. This was going to be hugely entertaining, and I could only speculate at the outcome. But outcome there would be — I knew my PA inside out.
When Angela appeared with the coffee, she looked even more cheekily innocent than she normally did, assuming such a thing was possible. She gave Liam a dazzlingly shy smile of greeting, set down our coffees, and then walked very slowly around his chair, enjoying his puzzled appreciation. Men never seem to know how to respond to her, and he was no different — despite wearing a dress that was sensationally short, she managed to radiate her usual air of tomboyish virginity and I could tell he couldn’t cope with it at all. When she was standing right behind him, her coral lips formed the word, ‘Liam?’ and when I returned an imperceptible nod, she mimed sending a text. Then she was gone, leaving a waft of perfume to linger with her memory.
Liam was wide-eyed. ‘Who was that?’ he asked, jumping to his feet as soon as the door closed. He kept staring as if willpower alone could bring her back.
I studied my nails. ‘My PA. Now, drink your coffee, and be a love, I have some work to do.’
My phone went crazy with incoming texts, so many that in the end I excused myself and walked over to Angela’s office.
Her eyes were wide. ‘Is that really Liam?’
I sat on the edge of her desk. ‘Yep.’
She came up very close, spreading my legs so that she could stand between them. ‘I want to see you having sex with him.’
This was the Angela who had me in her palm. ‘You can’t,’ I whispered. ‘You just can’t!’
Her hand slipped inside my knickers and her fingertip went unerringly for its target. ‘You don’t understand. I really really want to see you have sex with him,’ she breathed, slipping two fingers inside as my pussy went to mush.
‘It isn’t possible,’ I hissed. ‘The situation is complicated enough as it is. Besides, you don’t even like having sex with men!’ On the last point I was confident, because in the time she had been with me I had established that Angela was almost exclusively lesbian in her tastes.
Angela didn’t let her eyes drop for a second as she began to work my clit with the ball of her thumb. ‘I don’t want to have sex with him,’ she replied, withdrawing her hand the precise moment before I would have come. ‘But I want to see you do it, and if you show me, then I will do anything you want me to do.’ This despite wearing an expression as if had she had just walked out of teaching Sunday school.
‘Do you want to be in the room with us, or what?’ Her finger was back at work, rubbing my clit through my panties now, and as the two layers of material slid against each other, the feeling began to build until I could hardly think straight. I was gripping the desk and had to force the words out.
‘All I want is to see him in here, filling you, while you squirm and sweat with lust. I know you won’t fail me. I want to see him sink into you until your pussy can take no more of him and then I want you to look at me when he comes.’ She increased her speed until I gasped and came, mostly for thinking of the scene she had just conjured up. Then I knelt while she stood over me and let me service her dripping slit. Her orgasms were quiet, controlled and ladylike, and as soon as they were done, she slipped two fingers deep inside before releasing her knickers. She held them out so I could them clean. ‘Another coffee?’ she asked, with a brilliant smile, for all the world as if she was seeking approval after finishing typing her first business letter.
In the end it turned out to be easier than I could possibly have hoped. After a brief struggle with my conscience, I rationalised that we used video in training all the time at work, so why not for teaching Liam about sex? When we got back home, I changed into a plunge bra and a dress I hadn’t worn in ages and worked the conversation around to the idea.
‘Like we do our own home porno flick?’ He sounded genuinely entertained by the idea. ‘If we do, I promise there won’t be any fast forward stuff.’
I took my courage in my hands and told him I wanted to film it with a proper video camera. To be honest, I could have told him that I wanted to video us having sex on a Swiss roll and he would probably have agreed — now that I had solved his problem he was desperate to make up for lost time.
The practical side of him soon took over. ‘But who is going to film it?’
With as much matter of factness as I could muster, I replied, ‘Angela. She does all our training videos,’ which was true, for I had spent thousands sending her on endless courses on editing and lighting. I just about managed to keep my voice level, because for all her expertise, it wasn’t quite the same as filming a blue movie.
I needn’t have worried. Liam blew out his lips at the thought, and shook his head, as though he couldn’t believe his luck. ‘Is there any chance that she…?’
‘Maybe, but she isn’t really much attracted to men, darling. Besides, I want you to myself for a while.’ I stroked his hair. ‘Angela says we are going to need two or three cameras, to get all the angles, so she will have her work cut out.’
Maybe Sue’s frank accounts of her sexual experiences had paved the way, but to this Liam said no more than, ‘Why not?’ Then, ‘You have already discussed this with her?’
I realised that I had very nearly let the cat out of the bag, so I leaned over, enjoying the thirst in his eyes as he drank in my cleavage. ‘You don’t fancy her more than me, I hope?’ I asked, pressing my upper arms against my boobs to make them pop.
He spluttered, ‘No, certainly not.’
‘But you do fancy her?’
‘Well, yeah, but who wouldn’t? Are you sure she is alright with this?’ He made it sound as if his major worry was that it wouldn’t go ahead. I felt a flood of relief, mixed with the sort of urgent sexual anticipation that only Angela could create in me.
‘Leave me to talk to her, okay? She does whatever I want.’ It was the only white lie of the evening.As they walked in the room he handed her an envelope. They were coming back from dinner at a posh place in the rooftop of one of the tallest buildings in London. She looked radiant in her little black dress and high heels. It was a celebration of sorts, and the night was still young.
He had flown in early in the afternoon and as soon as they had checked into the room they were fucking like bunnies. Going for dinner had been a necessary break to gather energy and fresh air for the encore session they were about to start. She looked in his mischievous eyes and asked:
“What’s in the envelope?”
He explained that he had written a bunch of positions on a set of cards and she could use them to choose the next position in which she wanted to be shagged. He was always having these unorthodox ideas, and now she was curious. She opened it up and found a familiar set of positions written down:
Missionary on the sofa
Monkey in the bathroom sink
Doggy standing by the mirror
Flat on the belly
…
One card caught her attention. She held it in her hand and looked up at his dark chocolatey eyes:
“What is upside down spoons?”
He answered that he would be happy to show her, as a naughty smile flashed across his face. She loved that look in his eyes, and felt her inner works jump with emotion. It made her feel so wanted, and gave her goosebumps. He helped her off with her coat, and then her shoes.
He had actually helped dress her up before dinner. He liked doing that, and she knew it was a strange kink but she liked it. As she had been lying naked in bed he had gathered the clothes she had brought for the occasion. He had gotten her garter belt on first, then her black stockings. He had then wrapped her up in her short black dress, no bra. And had finished by pulling her panties up.
She liked it when he did that to her. It was a special feeling of being cared for, even if it meant that she had to help with the stockings and correct her dress as she was getting her make up done in the bathroom.
As they were walking to the restaurant she felt some of their mixed juices dripping from her. During dinner it was a constant reminder of their hard workout that afternoon.
They started kissing. Soft in the lips. Her hands busy unbuttoning his shirt. His hands pulling up her dress. She was enjoying the feeling of his warm touch on her. And his hurry to get his hands under her clothes to caress her bare skin. He pulled the zipper of her dress down and helped her out of it, as she opened his shirt and got her hands on his chest.
They also liked undressing each other. It felt as if they were unwrapping their presents. She put her hands up to help him get her out of her dress. As he pushed her dress above her boobs, she started caressing him with soft touches of her fingernails.
She fell back onto the bed as he started kissing her right nipple. She loved the way he circled its tip with his tongue, making it wet and slurping on it until it felt as if her whole boob was made out of stone. As he moved to her other breast she could also feel how he was getting rid of his shirt and trousers.
She liked to lie in bed and have him do things to her. She had told him before how she enjoyed giving up control to him. After he got her second nipple wet and hard he started cruising her body with his mouth. Discovering every inch of her, kiss by kiss. As he got to the bottom of her rib cage she felt how he was sucking harder on her. He was marking the path through her using hickeys instead of breadcrumbs.
She was still lying in bed with her hands up and her dress covering her face. In a way as if she were blindfolded, except that she could free herself at any time. She felt him going down past her belly button and proceeding to her panties.
Her panties were wet, as in extra wet. He removed them and started exploring her vulva with his mouth. He found a little concentrate of their juices at her entrance. It almost felt like candy. He got as much as he could on the tip of his tongue and moved up to kiss her. He had to move the dress above her head to place the sweet dessert he had found on her mouth. She giggled when she realized what it was. As he was freeing her from her dress she asked him:
“So what about that upside down spoons you wrote about?”
He winked at her and moved her onto her side, as if he was going to spoon her from behind. Except that he placed his head at her feet and his knees on her back. He was indeed upside down from her. He opened up one of her legs as she reached for his shaft. It only took a few strokes to have him ready to go in. She placed the tip at her entrance and he moved up her hips to place himself in position.
The visuals were fantastic. She was so wet that he slid all the way in at the first push. He was kissing her left leg and holding her by her waist. She liked seeing how his cock was moving in and out of her. He told her with a wicked smile:
“ Remember how I told you I wanted to see how you masturbate? Well, now is the time. Show me how you touch yourself when we are not together and you are missing me!”
He got her hand on top of her clit and she started her little number, with two fingertips going up and down on top of it. He was moving slowly in and out, as she reached to his shaft to get some of their juices on her fingertips. Her fingers continued the dancing routine, except that the intimate atmosphere had now been replaced by the voyeurism of feeling his stare on her.
This felt so extremely hot to him. He could see in her face what she was experiencing. Every now and then she flashed a smile at him and looked in his eyes. She still had her stockings and garter belt on, and the view of her fantastic body from his vantage point was something out of this world. He could see in her expression how she was concentrating on her orgasm.
Her fingers were doing the final strokes and she knew she would be over the edge soon. The slow in and out dance was helping her build up. She opened her mouth to tell him:
“I am about to come…”
And with a few more caresses she arched her back and released the next batch of energy. He parked his cock all the way inside of her and could feel her shaking surrounding him. He was looking at her, as a spectator who has been given access to a very private show. A show built up of their love, of their want of each other, and from the build up of the days that they had not been together.
They agreed that these are the moments worth living for.Don’t speak to me with words
Talk with lips on skin
Scream with fingers on my back
Send your messageWhen it came to anal stuff she was a virgin. He had not pushed for it because it was not a kink that he was particularly looking for. However he knew from experience that there were girls who really, really liked it. So as they were cuddling in bed he brought the topic up. She was curious but since she did not know what to expect she was in no hurry to try it.
He was giving her oral pleasure, his tongue making pirouettes together with her clit, her labia being their dancefloor. She had her legs on his shoulders and was enjoying the slow and steady build up of energy down there. He had one hand by her butt crack, and the fingers of the other one were caressing the outside of her vulva.
He placed his finger at her entrance. She was relaxed and welcoming the visitor. She moved her hips to accommodate a better angle and his finger just slid inside of her. He felt her cushioned inside, which was extremely wet. He moved his index finger all the way in, but it was not enough. His middle finger came to the rescue and both made it as deep as they could get.
His tongue was concentrating on her clit as he looked up at her. She was observing him with a look of pleasure in her eyes. He paused and asked her:
“Do you want me to try through the back door?”
“If you want…” was her answer. After the long loving session her labia were so engorged that he knew she would probably be quite receptive to his finger. He moved his fingers out and placed the tip of the index one at her back entrance. He started playfully drilling in with a circular motion as she started moving her hips to accommodate this new sensation.
After a few strokes the finger made it all the way inside. He kept stroking as her moaning increased. He was focusing on her clit again and could feel that her emotions were about to overflow. His whole mouth was covering her pearl and he was sucking firmly. Suddenly the walls of her thighs came tumbling down with a roar.
He had brought some avocado oil-based organic lube for them to experiment with. She was now riding him on top. They had melted together again and did not know where one ended and the other started. During one of her motions away, his shaft came out of her. She flashed a mischievous look at him and grabbed his manhood with her hand, while the other one reached for the lube.
She got enough liquid on him and started stroking his cock. It was thick, but she really wanted to try to fit him inside through the back door. She guided the tip in place and started pushing down. It was a new feeling. His finger had just slid inside without much effort, but this thing was major work.
She placed her hands on his pelvis and closed her eyes as she started pushing down in little steps. Her nerves down there were in overdrive as she could feel a bit of a pang with every push. Slowly she made way for him; the deeper it got, the easier it became.
He was looking at her beautiful figure on top of him. Her face framed by her beautiful hair. Her breasts like two flowers in full bloom. His hands on her hips, trying to provide her with some support. She opened her eyes to look at him, and he could feel her internal emotion in her expression.
She moved down to place a kiss on his mouth, and told him:
“Here you go, my anal virginity, a present for you!”When your demure, beautiful wife suddenly proposes an orgy, do you:
a. ask further questions such as why? where? when? eh?
b. blurt out yes and fuck any negative consequences along with other people?
c. become instantly suspicious that this is a psychological mind game and refuse on the sacred grounds of monogamy?
d. suggest attempting reverse wheelbarrow first, or a quickie in a restaurant before the main course?
e. slowly back away from the alien in front of you?
Answer: none of the above. I laughed and said, ‘you’re taking the piss.’ But no piss was being taken. My wife had stolen the eyes of a nympho in heat. She’d even done research and produced colour coded post-it notes (ground rules, pros and cons etc) on sheets of A4.
‘Ah want to do something crazy,’ she said. ‘Don’t you?’
‘How dae you know about an orgy?’
‘A mate of mines was telling me she goes to one her mate arranges. They’re in right now.’
‘What mate is this?’
‘You don’t know her. Ah met her at the gym.’ Question overload. Do you… fuck it.
‘Why not?’ This was me trying not to play it cool like I had a fluffer and an extremely glamorous monthly STD check. ‘If it’s something you want to try, let’s do it. Are you alright with me, you know, doing things with other women?’
‘Are you alright with me doing things with women?’
‘Aye. Ah think ah can live with that.’
‘What about guys?’
‘Ah don’t think am ready to fuck a guy; orgy or no orgy.’
‘Ah meant me.’ Just make out you’re fine with it. Think of the greater good.
We arrive at the orgy headquarters in a leafy suburb far removed from our flat. My wife’s friend of a friend is obviously in the highest council tax band. The lucky bastard. I already fear this will be a scene from the class struggle as I treat this house like a hotel and steal bathroom supplies I might not need.
The place is massive inside and everyone is a bit too friendly, but the drinks are flowing. I suppose that’s vital given the purpose of the visit. The wine makes me feel more comfortable or less panic-stricken as I watch people slowly disappear upstairs past strange erotic art that must be taken down when the family comes to visit. My wife’s doppelgänger asks me if I like the look of certain women. This has to be some sort of elaborate ploy to question my commitment to her. I am unenthusiastic and use nice safe words.
The designated fuck spots in the bedrooms upstairs are filling up. I am now half-drunk and full-horny. These feelings are added to pensive, suspicious, scared and oddly melancholic. A couple befriend us with inane getting to know each other questions. It’s all a bit normal and unorgy like — not that I’m an expert when it comes to the etiquette. I respectfully pretend I need to piss and explore upstairs where doors are shamelessly open; I can see flesh writhing on flesh and people ignoring the searing pain in their knees. I have a nice, long look and take it all in.
I return to my wife who is eager to get going before she loses her nerve. Ourselves and a few other unsure orgy virgins are left dotted around the downstairs area. We are now at the stage where upstairs with the tits and cocks at every turn seems much more relaxing.
‘You okay?’ my wife asks.
‘Aye, in the pink.’
‘Let’s go upstairs,’ she says.
My cock is still flaccid, but I cajole it into a semi by looking in a few of the bedrooms. A gym-sculpted naked woman comes to a door and leads my wife in by the hand. They kiss and leave me looking like a sad animal in an unimpressive zoo. My wife finally remembers she came with a husband and pulls me in. There’s a woman being spit-roasted and a couple masturbating like an American general has launched a preemptive strike on Moscow. My cock responds and quickly assumes complete domination of my feeble brain.
The cock is rapidly rubbered up and in the mouth of another woman. My socks are still on and so are my trousers, but I have dispensed with the top half, which is folded neatly in the corner — my wife’s work after I dumped the shirt at my feet. Why didn’t I take the rest of it off when I had the chance? Now it seems disrespectful to take my cock out of this stranger’s mouth. What’s the protocol here? Never mind. Here comes a dick with nothing but glasses on to masturbate way too close to me for comfort. That’s my cue to get the rest of my clothes off. The socks are a bit of a struggle but they come off without me falling on my arse. Result. I come back to resume my blowjob, but the dick has moved in on my territory. Now I really am a spare prick. I get down on my knees behind my wife and lick her wet pussy.
A masturbating woman in the corner is definitely a turn-on. My eyes focus on her to avoid the cock and arse of the dick standing far too near to my wife. She catches me ogling and makes her way over to put her pussy in my face while I fuck my wife. As Thursday nights go, this in the top ten weirdest. Another guy enters the fray and seems enamoured with my wife, but my cock is staying inside her until he fucks off. I am the orgy spoilsport.
After some rearranging of bodies and embarrassed guffaws, I’m subjected to my wife sucking another man’s cock. I grin and bear it with my cock inside a beautiful, dark-skinned woman, who is a bit theatrical and fond of a verbal barrage. Her demands for me to go harder and deeper draw a few looks from the rest of the shaggers around the room. Eventually I have to get out of her to fly under the radar and not prematurely cum.
I continue wading through a raging sea of pointless, amazing pussy and trying not to cum. Inevitably, I cannot think about enough disgusting stuff to stop myself; it simply has to done. Realising you’ve attracted an audience to watch you cum is a bit disconcerting once the insane wears off. If you’re like me, your sexual hang ups may suddenly bulldoze through paper thin walls like a puritanical Kool-Aid Man.
I am in a rush to leave and not make eye contact with those still participating, especially the ones who want you to linger and salivate like a subjugated dog in front of a demented psychiatrist. No thank you. No more dinner for me. I am full. My fuck-crazy doppelgänger sticks around for another ten minutes, while I think about how to get my real wife back from the black lodge until I’m hard again. Her only disappointment is the absence of cuddling. There’s no cuddling after an orgy; at least not at this one. We will make up for the lack of that once we get home. Kung Fu death grip cuddles are coming.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.

I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.
Follow MyErotica for refined erotic fiction to ignite your deepest desires.Shallow breaths
As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
HeThe first time, I was pretty sure I was seeing things. I was in my towel, fresh out the shower, ready to pick my undies before heading out for my uni class in town. Deciding what to wear, I had this vague, mostly subconscious sense that my bras and panties weren’t quite laid out how they were the previous morning.
The second time, I was convinced someone had been in my panty drawer. Some of my panties and thongs we definitely not arranged how I’d left them.
I felt pissed. Which of my housemates was going through my personal stuff? There were five of us living together. Two girls, three guys. None of them seemed the sort who’d go through my lingerie. Then again: how would I know?
The third time I caught him. Sat on my bed, with my favorite black lace panties wrapped around his cock. He was pumping himself hard and fast.
“What the fuck, James?” I said angrily, turning on the light.
“Shit,” was all he managed. And then again: “Shit.”
I’ve never seen anyone look so panicked. Deer in the headlights didn’t come close to it.
He took my panties off his cock, left them on my bed, and zipped himself back up. Then, unable to look me in the eyes, he walked straight past me, head down, and up to his top floor bedroom.
Two hours later I was lying in bed, unable to sleep.
The anger had subsided. Bizarrely, the initial feelings of violation had now turned to intrigue.
I’d never thought of any of my housemates as anything but friends. And now suddenly I couldn’t help but think about James differently.
He was into me.
My thoughts lingered for a moment on seeing his cock.
Out of nowhere, I felt a slight shudder of pleasure go through me thinking about my sexiest panties wrapped around it. Without even realizing, my hand had slipped down between my legs.
What was I thinking? I was shocked at myself. I wanted to feel angry again. That was the normal response I should be having. Right? But I couldn’t get the anger back. Suddenly the whole thing felt thrilling.
Before I could stop myself, I picked up my phone. And I texted him.
“Next time, just ask, okay?”
My heart was racing. What was I doing? I felt instant regret.
Then I heard my phone beep.
“Next time?”
Out of nowhere I felt this longing to see his cock again. With my panties wrapped around it. I wanted to watch him do it.
“How about now?” I wrote impulsively.
“?” he replied instantly.
Did I really want to do this? What was I getting myself into?
Fuck it, I thought.
“Come down and play with my panties again…while I watch,” I texted.
My left hand was rubbing my clit through my panties as I typed on the phone with my right. I hadn’t felt turned on like this in ages. Maybe never quite like this.
My phone beeped again.
“Are you serious?”
I found myself getting almost annoyed at his hesitancy, firing off an instant reply.
“Yes! Now get the fuck down here already.”
I heard the floorboards creak. His room was directly above mine. And then his slow footsteps down the stairs. He knocked gently on my door. Walked in, smiling sheepishly.
He didn’t know what to say.
“I want to watch you jerk off in my panties,” I told him, suddenly feeling bold in a way that surprised me.
I lifted the bedcover off and moved so I was sitting on top of it instead. I indicated for him to come and sit next to me. He was still fully dressed and clearly nervous. I found it quite endearing. And it made me want to take charge like I never had before.
“Take your jeans and boxers off,” I told him.
He could hardly look at me, but did it immediately. I smiled when I saw his cock. So big and hard. Maybe he was nervous, but he was as turned on as I was.
“Now take my panties off for me.”
He looked at me, stunned. I could tell he was about to come out with this ‘are you serious’ line again, so I didn’t let him.
“Yes, I’m serious. Take them off. I want you to use these when you jerk off.”
I knelt up. He moved towards me. He slid his hands up the outside of my thighs, under my short nightdress, and up to my black panties. Yes, the ones I’d caught him playing with before.
Feeling his hands on me was mesmerizing. It was tempting to just have sex. But I was determined to watch him play with himself in my panties.
He peeled my panties off me. Instinctively he moved them straight to his face. I totally got off on watching him sniff my panties. I’d never even thought about anything like this and now it was driving my imagination wild.
Then he took my panties and, while looking into my eyes, wrapped them around his oh-so-delicious looking cock.
Instantly he let out a quiet moan as he touched himself for the first time.
I felt so wet that I was sure I was dripping.
I watched him rub himself slowly with my panties. I wasn’t even sure why this was such a turn on. But it was.
I sat on my bed, back to the wall, and parted my legs. I began to play with myself as he sat on the side of my bed rubbing himself harder and faster.
When he turned and saw me, his eyes widened.
“Fuuuucck,” I heard him whisper.
I could tell he was about to come soon.
I was desperate to see him come all over my panties. I don’t even know why. But I wanted it so badly. Needed it.
And then he did.
His body convulsed in front of me. And I watched as he came, covering my panties. I felt myself getting close to my own orgasm now too.
Another thought flashed into my mind.
“Lick my panties,” I told him. “I want to watch you lick your own cum out of my panties.”
James was so turned on he would have done anything.
And he did.
I watched him lick my panties, feeling more aroused than ever in my life.
“Now come and lick me.”
He didn’t hesitate. He lay between my legs, and moved his mouth to my pussy. I grabbed his head, pulling him tight towards me.
It didn’t take long. I was ready. Barely a minute after his tongue moved around my clit, I was ready to explode.
I squirted all over his face.
I’d never squirted before.I expect my Master soon
and knowing His pleasures, I must
prepare myself for His arrival.
I see myself reflected,
corsetted tight and waist nipped in
black, the way He wants me.
I look to check that
seams are straight and too high heels that
thrust my body into provocation.
I scent the room and
light soft candles, making shadows play upon
the body that will be His to use.
I find His ballgag and
part my lips to take it deep, and tighten the strap
so my cheeks bulge with violation.
I ensure His whip is hanging
where He may reach it when need arouses
and mark me in ways He pleases.
I caress the steel of cuffs
between my fingers, wanting to see them
glittering against yielding skin.
I feel compulsion in His iron bed
that will welcome my spread-eagled body
each shackle open with invitation.
I reach down to encircle ankles
to hear the sound of metal closing
moistening me wide for surrender.
I strain above my head to reach the bars
stretched tight is the way He wants me, I must
tighten steel upon my wrists.
I am here for Him now
knowing not when He will come, only that desire
will grow with the waiting.
I can only stare upwards
knowing that when He comes,
I will be only His.
101 Poems for kinky lovers, by Francesca Anderssen is available in paperback and on the Amazon kindle marketplace.Take me as your very own
tie me as your love demands
use me now and use me fully
force me down to your commands
I need to know your chains upon me
such craving there will always be
to want your ropes to hurt my body
so your bonds will set me free
Submission is my total needing
wanting you to make it so
taking me to places strangely
where I cannot help but go
You’re the one who now must hold me
I’ve sold myself to your control
with my freedom gone forever
now that you possess my soul
So tie me tighter yet and tighter
my screams must bite the gag you give
use my mind to make me suffer
this is how I want to live.

Mimi Bordeaux
Nov 7, 2016
Audrey is sitting in a cocktail lounge. She’s sipping her Cosmo, thinking to herself, ‘I deserve a night out. I work hard. It will be nice to enjoy a few drinks.’ She’s happy with her attire and looks elegant. She’s wearing a little black dress with a strand of pearls and her hair is tied up in a French roll.
A plain looking girl enters the bar. She never goes to bars but tonight she’s decided to be adventurous as it’s a warm summer evening. As she walks in she looks around nervously for an empty table. She is thinking, ‘I want to have an encounter… with anyone.’ She has never been in a proper relationship and at 26 she thinks it’s time.
She’s ordering her drink at the bar — a Shirley Temple — when she notices the elegant woman sitting there. Audrey is lost in her own thoughts, but her interest is piqued by Jane’s request for the non-alcoholic drink. She swings her bar stool around to look at her.
Jane summons up the courage to blurt out, “Oh hello… do you come here often?” She feels like a fool for her clichéd opening gambit, but she continues anyway. “I don’t usually go to bars, but here I am.”
Audrey coolly replies, “I like to go out alone and have a few drinks by myself.” She looks Jane up and down, notices that she’s actually rather sweet looking despite her plain clothes, senses her air of barely contained excitement. Her tone becomes warmer. “It’s quite dull here actually. How about you come back to my place and tell me all about yourself?”
“There’s not much to tell,” Jane says nervously, but before she really knows what’s happening she’s agreed to go back to Audrey’s place anyway.
It’s not far by taxi to Audrey’s luxurious apartment. ‘Oh, this is exciting!’ Jane thinks to herself. She still lives with her mother in an ordinary suburban house. Audrey offers her a drink and tells her to make herself comfortable, while she gets changed. She disappears through the double doors leading to her bedroom. Jane looks around; she’s never seen such opulence and she thinks Audrey must be very worldly.
Audrey returns. She has been busy putting on her outfit. She stands there, imposing, looking even taller in fishnet stockings and thigh high leather boots with spike heels. Her black corset barely contains her voluptuous breasts. She is wearing a dog collar around her neck and a black leather mask. She holds a black whip which she flicks every second.
She stares at Jane and says, “Go through that door,” gesturing towards a red leather door off the bedroom with the whip. Jane’s heart is racing. She’s apprehensive but excited by Audrey’s domineering tone. She does as she’s told and enters the room with Audrey following, flicking the whip at her behind. First softly, then a hard crack that stings Jane’s buttocks.
Jane perches on a stool in the middle of the room, the only place to sit, and glances around at her surroundings. Chains, ropes and leather straps hang from the ceiling and walls. She shivers at the sight.
Audrey slams the door shut and barks, “Did I give you permission to sit down?” Jane is confused. Audrey walks toward her, flicking the whip, and stands over her. “Open your legs.” Jane does as she’s told. “Are you getting wet? You must be excited.” Jane squirms, feeling wetness between the tops of her thighs. She’s never felt this way before. There’s a tingling sensation she can’t fathom. It’s because of Audrey.
Jane looks up. Audrey is staring at her and in a second has Jane’s head in her hands. She swipes her tongue up Jane’s cheek then to her mouth, biting hard on the lower lip. She rolls her tongue around Jane’s lips and forcefully enters her mouth, her tongue pushing in deep, grabbing onto Jane’s tongue with her teeth.
Audrey kneels, pulls Jane’s skirt and panties off and moves her head between Jane’s legs. Jane is quivering and needs to hold onto something but there’s nothing except Audrey. She puts her hands on Audrey’s head, winds her fingers into the elegantly coiffured hair. Audrey licks all the way from Jane’s asshole to her clit. She sticks her tongue in Jane’s cunt. In out, in out. She does it over and over again, licking Jane’s whole crack and tongue-fucking her deeper and deeper. Then she focuses on Jane’s clit, licking more softly.
Jane is overwhelmed by the attention and instinctively opens her legs wider. Audrey sucks and nibbles on her swollen clit, licking voraciously. Jane’s head is swimming, she thinks she may faint and her legs are trembling uncontrollably. There’s a fluttering in her stomach like an eel spinning around. She’s sweating, her chest is burning and her face is flushed. She’s on the verge of something, a sensation she’s never felt before. It’s building up from her toes, up her legs; between them she feels a gush of fluid. Suddenly she throws her head back, straining, her eyes tight shut; she grabs Audrey’s head and makes a high-pitched involuntary screech. She can’t think, see or hear any more, but she’s screaming out her pleasure as she slides off the stool.
“Shut up!” Audrey says harshly, pulling her to her feet and leading her by the neck to some ropes hanging from the ceiling. She ties Jane’s hands tightly and tells her to bend over. Jane is giddy, but she does as she’s told. There’s a sound behind her, then she feels something touching her cunt. It thrusts inside her, going right to the hilt, then out again. It goes in again and starts to move slowly, in out, in out. Jane moans as the thrusting becomes more intense.
Now it’s moving more quickly, sending waves of heat up Jane’s body. She moans and whispers, “Yes… oh yes!” as Audrey pumps her cunt with force. Audrey slams the dildo in, pressing at a special spot that has Jane intoxicated. Jane can’t hold back any longer and yells out, clutching at the rope, sweat dripping from her forehead, her cunt soaking wet and squirting juices that dribble down her thighs.
Audrey turns Jane around and thrusts the dildo into her mouth, making her gag for a moment before she adjusts to its size. “Suck!” says Audrey sternly. The dildo is coated with cum and Jane tastes her own juice for the first time.
Audrey unties Jane’s wrists and buckles a dog collar around her neck, with a short leash attached. She leads her to a wooden table. “Bend over and put your ass in the air, slut,” she commands her. The words have an instant effect on Jane, who feels her cunt swell and throb, more wetness trickling down her thighs. She’s so turned on.
Audrey holds onto the leash and rubs her finger against Jane’s asshole. Jane feels something cold and sticky being spread over her, and then Audrey’s fingertip wriggling into her ass. It feels strange, but good. The finger goes a little deeper, and then suddenly thrusts all the way inside. She yells.
“Shut up, slut,” Audrey says, adding a second finger and pumping them in and out of Jane’s ass. Jane lies flat against the table, ass up, and takes it. She starts to like it. She moans with each stroke.
“You like that do you, my little slut?” Audrey says, going deeper and faster. Jane is dizzy with excitement, growling and howling. Her orgasm fires through her whole body, radiating out from her core.
After a few minutes Audrey withdraws her fingers and Jane slumps down onto the table, exhausted. Audrey grabs the leash, making Jane stand, then removes the collar. She stares at Jane. She grabs her head and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck, then kisses her on the mouth.
“Time for you to go home,” she says. “You know the way out.” She marches Jane to the red door and pushes her through it, throwing her clothes after her. Jane dresses rapidly and staggers to the front door. Her pussy and ass are throbbing as she runs down the stairs. She’s floating. She feels like a bird in flight. She begins to walk.This girl looks exactly like me. The same long, wavy blonde hair. The same blue-grey eyes, the sprinkling of freckles over the bridge of her nose. The same slender fingers, moving to my nipple, as mine move to hers. We could be twins.
Only the tattoo on my back and the one on her foot mark us apart. She laughs when she undresses me and sees mine.
“Maybe I need to get one like it,” she says, getting down on her knees to kiss it, lick it; her tongue moving lower, down the cleft of my ass.
We met earlier that night, in a bar.
Coming face to face, I think for a moment that I’m walking into a mirror. We stare at each other for a long while, fascinated.
Before long we’ve both ditched our dates and are huddled in a corner, insulated from the noise of the bar by our absorption in each other. We’re drunk on the sight of each other, cataloguing the myriad points on which we are the same and the few tiny differences, obsessively.
“You’re just like me,” we keep telling each other.
When she asks my name and I say, ‘Narcisse,’ she laughs delightedly, getting the reference at once: Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection and died for love of himself.
She tells me hers is ‘Belle,’ which I know means beautiful; I’m not sure whether or not she’s lying but I like the inference, so I call her Belle anyway.
A little later and we’re sitting so close she’s practically on my lap, kissing avidly.
“Bet you’d fuck yourself if you could, wouldn’t you?” she says.
“Of course I would. Wouldn’t you?” She nods, unabashed. “Want to find out what it feels like?”
She nods again, runs a fingertip up my thigh as she leans in to whisper, “Your place or mine?”
My place then, the bedroom lights blazing so we can see every minute detail of each other as we undress, touch, explore. Every inch of her body looks strangely familiar. I lick each smooth expanse of skin as I uncover it, mapping the territory as I go, noting each hair and freckle. She shivers with arousal as I kiss her neck and then on downward, cupping a breast and sucking the nipple; she moans and I feel it harden against my tongue. Her responsiveness pleases me and my own nipples stiffen in sympathy, as if what I’m doing to her is physically mirrored in my own trembling flesh. I suck harder, my hands encircling her waist and running down over her hips.
I kiss and lick my way down her taut stomach, feeling it ripple at my light touch, then slide her panties down to her thighs and gaze at her pussy, enthralled. A neat tuft of blonde curls crowns her smooth, plump-lipped cunt. It’s like looking at myself from an angle I’ve never experienced before. I stare and stare until the intensity makes her fidget and she breaks the spell by pulling me onto the bed, breathless and flushed.
“What do you like?” she asks; meaning: how shall I get you off?
“You know what I like,” I reply, meaning: we’re the same. I like what you like.
Turns out I’m both right and wrong. She starts out gentle and teasing, kissing and licking around the edge of my skimpy panties, sucking my inner thigh, then licking me through the thin fabric until I’m dripping. By the time she peels my panties off and skims a fingertip along the slippery groove between my lips, I’m fighting the urge to tell her faster, harder, fuck me now! But it seems the teasing is what I wanted after all. Her touch is insistent, hypnotic, a slow build to a long drawn-out orgasm that has me screaming when she finally lets me come with three fingers plunging into my drenched hole and her lips suctioned around my clit.
I roll her onto her back and straddle her, kissing her insatiably, licking my cream from her lips. Pulling back to look into her eyes, I’m giddy with lust. For one vertiginous moment I feel as if I’m falling into a mirror, fucking myself into insanity.
Now all I can think about is tasting her. I spin around into a sixty-nine so I can hover my pussy over her face, too sensitive from my orgasm for much contact but shivering with arousal as she flicks her tongue delicately over my folds. My approach is more direct, more brutal; she’s shown me how she likes to be touched and now I’m teaching her my way. Spreading her open with my fingers, I swipe my tongue across her clit, over and over, relentless. My elbows pin her knees apart, my weight pinioning her so however much she squirms, she can’t escape the overpowering sensations. When she’s moaning and babbling deliriously, her hips juddering as she tries to hump up against my tongue, I thrust two fingers from each hand inside her, stretching her open and curling them to seek out her G-spot. Her hips buck so hard she nearly throws me off her as she comes, soaking my hands. She tastes just like me and that thought, coupled with the way she sucks fiercely at my cunt as she loses it, makes me come again.
We lie facing each other, and gaze into each other’s eyes, absorbing this information, the new things we’ve learned about ourselves from each other.
“I never knew I could come like that,” she says, wonderingly.
“I never knew I liked to be teased so much,” I laugh. She reaches for me again, kissing me hard as she slides one leg between my thighs, hooking the other over my hip. A little shuffling and we’re grinding together, pussy to pussy, both so hot and wet. There’s just enough friction to drive me out of my mind, my clit throbbing as I rub against her, hips moving in tight circles. This time, coming feels like hurtling down a long, dark tunnel into an explosion of light. I don’t know if the hammering against my chest is her heart or mine. The sense of consummation is profound.
We’ve been kissing and fingering, licking and sucking and fucking each other for so many hours it’s daylight when we finally disengage, blissed out and exhausted.
“Can I see you again,” she asks.
“You’ll see me every time you look in the mirror,” I reply.Watching your wife get fucked by another man is a real thrill, there is no doubt about that. But there are some cucks who want to take it even further. How can you go further than fucking? Cucks like me, we don’t just want our wives to cheat on us with their bodies. What we long for, more than anything else, is for our wives to develop real feelings for the bull.
It is called emotional cuckoldry. And it is not for the faint of heart. It is for people who are willing to really test their own inner strength. Maybe you suspect that it would be nice to watch your wife falling for another. I mean, it brings the excitement of competition to the surface, after all. But then, your heart gets kind of stamped on as she reveals to you the truth — that not only does he have a bigger cock than you, but he has also managed to awaken a real heart connection in her. Yes, that’s exciting too. But it is also incredibly scary. It means she might leave you.
And this is the real juice.
We emotional cuckolds must have had some abandonment issues in the past. And this fear of abandonment somehow is fused in our psyche with eroticism. So when the idea that our wife might leave first presents itself, the lump we feel in our throat is like nothing else. It unearths a desire and an excitement in us that is reckless — almost unlawful. Certainly taboo. We are not supposed to enjoy this. We must be masochistic, though, because we do. It hurts so good. So good.
It first happened to me with Ben, a guy that my wife had started fooling around with at work.
I knew she had a crush on him, that much she had confessed to me. But she hadn’t told me any of the details. I had assured her it was OK for her to pursue this crush, but she didn’t trust me, I guess. But finally, we had a date night, planned a week in advance, and I was able to get some of the details out of her.
It was dinner at The Corner Place, our favorite casual but awesome Italian. I waited until we had both ordered and had sipped a little red wine. Then I hit her with it.
“So, Lexy,” I said. “I’ve known you for a long time. You know, three years before we even started dating. Three years of dating. One year of marriage. That’s seven years.”
“Uh huh. Good math skills.”
She’s funny, I’ll give her that.
“I know you honey,” I said. “You can’t, you know…”
“I can’t what?”
“Well, I know you. And I would know if you weren’t, you know, telling me everything…”
“Oh, can we not talk about Ben tonight,” she said. “Can we just have a date night, me and you. Without Ben.”
“Of course.”
Shut down.
She shut me right down. Now I had to sit with these feelings. She was totally cheating on me. I mean, I knew she was cheating on me. But even this, being totally cheated on by the person who was cheating on me, by her withholding the details. Even this, I loved it.
It was a tortuous but lovely feeling.
We got through the whole date night. Got in bed, and I started making love to her. And as I was going down on her, I said, “Mmm, this tastes so good.” And then I just coyly asked her, “Has Ben tasted how good this tastes?”
“Mmmhmmm,” she murmured.
“I’m sorry,” I said, between licks of her clit. “Was that a yes?”
“Mmmmhmm,” she said.
“When did the lucky boy taste that?” I said, coming up for air.
“A couple days ago,” she gasped; she was almost ready to climax now. “We went back to his apartment at lunch. He wanted to fuck me. But I couldn’t.”
“So he just ate you,” I said.
“Mmmhmmm.”
“Did you cum?”
“Mmmhmmm.”
“And…”
“Oh shut up, I’m going to cum!”
And I concentrated on my work and made her cum real well. Then she went down and started reciprocating on my cock.
“Ah, and has Ben been as lucky as me in this regard?” I asked.
“Oh Jesus,” she said. “I’m trying to suck a dick here. Are you going to interrogate me or do you want a blow job?”
“Just nod or shake your head. Have you sucked his dick?”
She nodded.
I felt so good then. We were complete again. We weren’t holding anything back.
“Was it a nice dick?”
She shrugged her shoulders, then she nodded. I guessed it was a pretty nice dick.
“Bigger or smaller than mine?”
She made a kind of sing-songy noise. I didn’t hear it at first. But when she repeated it, I took her to be sing-songing “a little bigger.”
“A little bigger?”
She nodded.
“That’s good. That’s very good.”
It was so good in fact that I shot my load right then.
She was pissed.
“Josh!” she said. “I wanted to get fucked! I really wanted you to fuck me on our date night. Damn it.”
She got in bed next to me. But she wasn’t the one who should be pissed. It was her fault. She’d never told me this. And then, to find it out this way, through my subterfuge, it was all so exciting, I couldn’t help myself when I finally saw her nodding and admitting to a blow job. I just came like crazy.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” I said, finally asking the question that had been hanging between us.
“I’m sorry honey,” she said. “I just…I just didn’t feel like…you know, going through the details…I wanted it to be something…private, between me and Ben. Just this one private thing. I mean, I think that’s all it’s ever going to be. I don’t think I can bring myself to fuck him. So he ate my pussy and he made me cum and I sucked his cock and I made him cum, but–”
“Did he cum in your mouth?”
“See,” she said.
“See what?”
“This! I mean, I thought we could do this, Josh. I thought you could be…cooler about it. But maybe you can’t…handle it, I don’t know. I am going to call the whole thing off.”
“No! I can handle it!” I panicked. I was anxious that she was going to call the whole thing off. That was the last thing I wanted. “I don’t want you to call it off.”
It was then that she just broke down crying like crazy. I thought it was all my fault.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” I said to her. But through her blubbering, I gathered that it wasn’t my fault.
“What is it, then?” I asked.
“Oh, Josh,” she said. “I am so sorry. But…I think I’m falling in love with him. I’m sorry!”
“In love with Ben?”
“Yes,” she cried. “I’ve had a crush on him for months, yes. But now that we have been fooling around, Josh, I feel different with him, to how I feel with you. I’m so sorry. I feel…in my heart for him, something that I guess I didn’t know was there. But I think that’s what you’re supposed to feel in your heart for someone you fuck. I guess I shouldn’t have married you because I don’t feel that in my heart for you. I am so sorry. Oh God, I am so sorry about this. But it’s been driving me crazy and I’ve just got to be honest and tell you.”
“Tell me what?” I asked.
“I don’t love you, Josh,” she said, through a river of tears. “I’m sorry, I just don’t!”
When I woke up, she was packing a bag.
“What?” I said. “What are you doing?”
“What do you think I’m doing? Did you not hear what I told you last night? Were you drunk?”
“No,” I said. “I heard everything.”
“Then you know, that’s why I’m packing. I don’t love you, Josh. I’ve got to move out.”
“No you don’t,” I said. “That’s the last thing I want.”
“Right. You want to be married to someone who doesn’t love you? How fucked up is that?”
“Well, you might think it’s fucked up,” I said. “But Lexy, you know…it’s perfect for me. In so many ways. I mean, you know my upbringing…you know what I’m used to. My family didn’t love me. They didn’t even want me. So this is exactly what I’m comfortable with. I am just glad that it’s finally out in the open. I mean, you don’t think I knew that you didn’t love me? I mean, on our wedding day you were practically making out with Srivanda out on the balcony. I saw that, you know? The reason I picked you, unconsciously or consciously, must be because I have never felt loved and I wanted to continue that with my adult family.”
“So you want to stay with me, even though I don’t love you?”
She looked at me in disbelief.
“Yes,” I cried. “I love you more than ever now. This is what I want. Unrequited love. I want to suffer. I love it.”
“You love it.”
“Oh my God, if I could somehow let you experience what I experienced last night when you confessed this all to me. If you had been able to feel my chest, the compressions there. It was so intense. And then the back of my throat. It was such a pressure. And in my balls and my cock. I started almost cumming in my pants as you detailed how much you had been faking it, and how you really didn’t love me at all. It was so intense. It was painful and for some reason, the most pleasant feeling I have ever felt. After you went to sleep last night I went to the bathroom and I beat off ten times, I was so horny. Looking at you now, I think I’m going to cum again, just seeing your loveliness, and knowing that you don’t want me — it gives you an unbelievable power, don’t you see. You’ve become…Cleopatra. Royal. Beautiful beyond belief. You’ve become divine. A Goddess I can serve, but never equal. You’ve become…my dream come true.”
She looked at me like I was totally out of my mind.
“Wow, she said. “I did not…expect that.”
She put down her bags.
“So you want me to stay?”
“Yes!” I said. “Please stay.”
“Alright,” she said, looking bewildered. “I’ll stay. For now anyhow.”
And that’s how I became an emotional cuckold. My wife didn’t tell me details about her sex with her boyfriend any more. She shared details about her emotional connection with him. How he made her feel all girlie and excited. She took me shopping when she wanted to buy him a special gift. She wrote me emails and even handwritten letters about what a crush she had on him, how sexy he was, and how wonderful and special a person he was. She drew little hearts. She put her name and his name inside the heart. She took loads of special selfies of the two of them hugging and she sent them all to me. She shared herself and her affair with me totally. Even more than totally. I had the feeling that she was exaggerating a lot of it just because she understood me so perfectly. She knew that the worse she made it for me, the more jealous and shut out I felt, the more excited I got. And she took me there. All the way. She gave me the ultimate thrill. She made me into an emotional cuckold.
My wife. I love her so!I’m walking behind this girl in skintight yoga pants as she leaves the gym, watching her ass shimmy with every step she takes. I’m so mesmerized by the ripple effect that I barely even notice where I’m going. Does my ass jiggle like that when I walk? I can hardly grab it in the street to find out, but it doesn’t feel like it does. Now I’d like to grab her ass and feel her flesh bounce and shake as she sits on my face…
She goes into a coffee shop, and I follow, suddenly seized by a craving for caffeine (and pussy). She sits at a table by the window, catches my eye and smiles invitingly. I’m surprised I don’t recognize her — I thought I knew all the hot girls at my gym — but when I ask if I can join her, the effusive response makes it clear she’s noticed me before.
The morning’s progression is no less enjoyable for being entirely predictable. I’m in my comfort zone here, seducing cute girls being one of my favorite pastimes. Another coffee? Flirtatious chat. Her hand brushes my thigh as she leans across me to reach for the sugar, and she lets it linger there for a moment. Lunch? She lives nearby, she could make us something to eat…
I’ve been looking forward to peeling down those tight yoga pants, but as soon as we get inside her apartment she gives me a quick, promising kiss on the lips, and tells me she wants my opinion on her new outfit. She disappears into the bedroom, leaving me tingling pleasurably with anticipation; and returns a few moments later looking like a walking wet dream. Black lace lingerie, lace-topped stockings, garter belt, high heels; it might be a cliché, but it suits her hourglass figure perfectly. The panties cup her pussy so snugly I can see the hint of a cameltoe, and have a thong back that leaves her magnificent ass cheeks exposed.
Let’s find out what else makes her ass jiggle…
I soon reach the conclusion that those panties look even better around her thighs as I bend her forward over the couch and slot my tongue inside her creamy cunt. She’s so wet I don’t waste any more time with teasing, sucking up her sweetness, licking and rubbing until any hint of nervous inhibition has dissolved under my oral onslaught and she’s moaning and mashing her soaking pussy against my face. I adore feeling a girl shake apart as I eat her out, and I have a feeling I can guess what will push her over the edge.
I pull her panties right down so she can step out of them, then spread her legs — and her cheeks — wider. I was right, she goes wild as I paint her wetness up her ass crack with my tongue, lapping at the tight pucker until I feel her entire body shivering. I press deeper, opening her up little by little. Her legs are quivering, her booty quaking delightfully against my face, and as the tip of my tongue breaches that tight ring of muscle she has one of the fiercest assgasms I’ve ever given a girl, without any significant penetration.
Her legs are too wobbly to support her after that, so I lie back and pull her onto my face, sucking on her clit as I thrust a finger all the way into her ass. It feels almost impossibly tight at first, but a string of mini orgasms courtesy of my lashing tongue makes her loosen up, and then the way she squirms and squeals as I finger-fuck her ass lets me know I’m hitting the spot. But she really goes crazy when I turn her around so she’s sitting her ass on my face in a squat position and grind my knuckles over her clit as I lick her asshole as hard and deep as I can. I’m lucky she doesn’t suffocate me as she sags down on top of me, her body jerking convulsively… although it wouldn’t be a bad way to go, surrounded by twitching girl-flesh.
As first dates go, that was pretty intense. She’s too dazed (and, I suspect, inexperienced in the ways of lady lovin’) to get me off very effectively with her tongue and fingers, so I’m still horny as I go home and make what under the circumstances I can only describe as a “booty call” to my fuck buddy Tony.
I’m stripped down to my G-string, looking at my ass in the full-length mirror in my bedroom, as he answers the phone.
“Tony, does my ass jiggle?” I ask him, in lieu of saying hello. I bounce up and down a bit on the bed, watching for the ripple effect.
“No,” he replies, “your ass is a firm little peach, baby.”
“Not even when I go on the elliptical trainer at the gym?” I ask, vaguely disappointed.
“No. By the way, you know I’m at work, right? Can we not discuss your sexy ass and all the things I’d like to do to it right now, please.”
“Not even when you bend me over and fuck me from behind?”
“No, but it jiggles when I spank it, and you’d better believe you’re going to get a good hard spanking later!” he growls, hanging up.
So now I have my second challenge of the day: can I wait until Tony gets here to spank me until my cheeks are glowing and then fuck me hard enough to make them ripple like jello?
Or…Part ten: Turned on by a sexy plan
When I finished telling Angela’s story I knew I had to go to work, so I swung my legs around my makeup stool to enjoy the sensation of his erection between my breasts for a moment.
‘Does Sue know about you and Angela?’ he asked.
‘Oh yes. I don’t keep anything from her.’ I adjusted my bra so it was more comfortable.
‘Isn’t she jealous?’
‘No… and how could she be, given she is married to Ted?’
The humour was unintentional, but Liam nearly choked all the same. ‘Wait till I tell Toby that!’
‘What about Toby?’
‘You got a problem with me telling him? He is the only person other than Sue — and you — that has never run out on me. I always tell him everything, anyway, he is the only member of my family I have left.’
On day one, Sue and I had agreed that my house would be the one place where Toby could be himself, so I knew him pretty well. ‘No, of course not… anyway, he is such a nice guy.’
Liam looked unsure for a second. ‘Have you ever let him wear your clothes?’
I checked my mascara. There was no point being anything but honest. ‘Yes I have.’ I watched him in the mirror, because I had absolutely no idea what his reaction was going to be.
‘Sue usually lets him do it the moment Ted leaves for work. It felt kinda weird at first, but hey it’s no big deal, apart from when Ted comes home unexpectedly. Man, have we had some narrow escapes.’ He thought for a moment. ‘So, if you let him dress in your clothes, have you ever had… had…’
‘Had sex with him? No. Remember, he is only just eighteen.’ I gave him a stern look. ‘And before you ask, I don’t think Sue has, either.’
‘Just curious. I never know with Sue or you. If either of you did, it would be good for him. He once told me he couldn’t imagine any woman would ever want to have sex with him. Poor guy.’
Liam sounded so completely matter of fact about his brother’s cross dressing and the whole thing seemed so problematic that I let it drop. ‘Hey, I have an idea. Grab your clothes, I want you to come into work and meet someone.’
By the time I pulled the 911 up in my parking space, Liam had done everything except read the manual and take the vehicle to pieces to see how it worked. When we got out, he announced, ‘It’s awesome, but it’s not exactly the kind of car…’ his voice trailed away.
‘…that you expect a woman to own?’ I replied, my eyes glinting.
He recovered himself. ‘Sue says you only got the first one you bought because it was more powerful than Ted’s.’
That was true. I threw a smile over my shoulder. ‘Still remember his little darling face the first time he laid eyes on it.’
‘Why don’t you like him?’
‘Why does everybody not like him? If he wasn’t so certain that he was right and everyone else was wrong, he would be a damn sight easier to get along with.’ I had lost track of how much unsolicited advice Ted had given me over the years — printed out, it would have filled many boring volumes to bursting point.
‘Who am I going to meet?’
I pressed my key fob on the car park exit door. ‘Patience. You will find out soon enough.’
As we rode the elevator I adjusted his shirt. ‘You look great. I would fuck you right here if it wasn’t for the glass walls.’
Liam was still laughing when we reached my office. I threw my bag on a chair and spread my arms. ‘Make yourself at home. Want a coffee?’ When he nodded, I pressed a button on the intercom. ‘Two coffees, one for me and another black with sugar.’
I sank into my chair. This was going to be hugely entertaining, and I could only speculate at the outcome. But outcome there would be — I knew my PA inside out.
When Angela appeared with the coffee, she looked even more cheekily innocent than she normally did, assuming such a thing was possible. She gave Liam a dazzlingly shy smile of greeting, set down our coffees, and then walked very slowly around his chair, enjoying his puzzled appreciation. Men never seem to know how to respond to her, and he was no different — despite wearing a dress that was sensationally short, she managed to radiate her usual air of tomboyish virginity and I could tell he couldn’t cope with it at all. When she was standing right behind him, her coral lips formed the word, ‘Liam?’ and when I returned an imperceptible nod, she mimed sending a text. Then she was gone, leaving a waft of perfume to linger with her memory.
Liam was wide-eyed. ‘Who was that?’ he asked, jumping to his feet as soon as the door closed. He kept staring as if willpower alone could bring her back.
I studied my nails. ‘My PA. Now, drink your coffee, and be a love, I have some work to do.’
My phone went crazy with incoming texts, so many that in the end I excused myself and walked over to Angela’s office.
Her eyes were wide. ‘Is that really Liam?’
I sat on the edge of her desk. ‘Yep.’
She came up very close, spreading my legs so that she could stand between them. ‘I want to see you having sex with him.’
This was the Angela who had me in her palm. ‘You can’t,’ I whispered. ‘You just can’t!’
Her hand slipped inside my knickers and her fingertip went unerringly for its target. ‘You don’t understand. I really really want to see you have sex with him,’ she breathed, slipping two fingers inside as my pussy went to mush.
‘It isn’t possible,’ I hissed. ‘The situation is complicated enough as it is. Besides, you don’t even like having sex with men!’ On the last point I was confident, because in the time she had been with me I had established that Angela was almost exclusively lesbian in her tastes.
Angela didn’t let her eyes drop for a second as she began to work my clit with the ball of her thumb. ‘I don’t want to have sex with him,’ she replied, withdrawing her hand the precise moment before I would have come. ‘But I want to see you do it, and if you show me, then I will do anything you want me to do.’ This despite wearing an expression as if had she had just walked out of teaching Sunday school.
‘Do you want to be in the room with us, or what?’ Her finger was back at work, rubbing my clit through my panties now, and as the two layers of material slid against each other, the feeling began to build until I could hardly think straight. I was gripping the desk and had to force the words out.
‘All I want is to see him in here, filling you, while you squirm and sweat with lust. I know you won’t fail me. I want to see him sink into you until your pussy can take no more of him and then I want you to look at me when he comes.’ She increased her speed until I gasped and came, mostly for thinking of the scene she had just conjured up. Then I knelt while she stood over me and let me service her dripping slit. Her orgasms were quiet, controlled and ladylike, and as soon as they were done, she slipped two fingers deep inside before releasing her knickers. She held them out so I could them clean. ‘Another coffee?’ she asked, with a brilliant smile, for all the world as if she was seeking approval after finishing typing her first business letter.
In the end it turned out to be easier than I could possibly have hoped. After a brief struggle with my conscience, I rationalised that we used video in training all the time at work, so why not for teaching Liam about sex? When we got back home, I changed into a plunge bra and a dress I hadn’t worn in ages and worked the conversation around to the idea.
‘Like we do our own home porno flick?’ He sounded genuinely entertained by the idea. ‘If we do, I promise there won’t be any fast forward stuff.’
I took my courage in my hands and told him I wanted to film it with a proper video camera. To be honest, I could have told him that I wanted to video us having sex on a Swiss roll and he would probably have agreed — now that I had solved his problem he was desperate to make up for lost time.
The practical side of him soon took over. ‘But who is going to film it?’
With as much matter of factness as I could muster, I replied, ‘Angela. She does all our training videos,’ which was true, for I had spent thousands sending her on endless courses on editing and lighting. I just about managed to keep my voice level, because for all her expertise, it wasn’t quite the same as filming a blue movie.
I needn’t have worried. Liam blew out his lips at the thought, and shook his head, as though he couldn’t believe his luck. ‘Is there any chance that she…?’
‘Maybe, but she isn’t really much attracted to men, darling. Besides, I want you to myself for a while.’ I stroked his hair. ‘Angela says we are going to need two or three cameras, to get all the angles, so she will have her work cut out.’
Maybe Sue’s frank accounts of her sexual experiences had paved the way, but to this Liam said no more than, ‘Why not?’ Then, ‘You have already discussed this with her?’
I realised that I had very nearly let the cat out of the bag, so I leaned over, enjoying the thirst in his eyes as he drank in my cleavage. ‘You don’t fancy her more than me, I hope?’ I asked, pressing my upper arms against my boobs to make them pop.
He spluttered, ‘No, certainly not.’
‘But you do fancy her?’
‘Well, yeah, but who wouldn’t? Are you sure she is alright with this?’ He made it sound as if his major worry was that it wouldn’t go ahead. I felt a flood of relief, mixed with the sort of urgent sexual anticipation that only Angela could create in me.
‘Leave me to talk to her, okay? She does whatever I want.’ It was the only white lie of the evening.As they walked in the room he handed her an envelope. They were coming back from dinner at a posh place in the rooftop of one of the tallest buildings in London. She looked radiant in her little black dress and high heels. It was a celebration of sorts, and the night was still young.
He had flown in early in the afternoon and as soon as they had checked into the room they were fucking like bunnies. Going for dinner had been a necessary break to gather energy and fresh air for the encore session they were about to start. She looked in his mischievous eyes and asked:
“What’s in the envelope?”
He explained that he had written a bunch of positions on a set of cards and she could use them to choose the next position in which she wanted to be shagged. He was always having these unorthodox ideas, and now she was curious. She opened it up and found a familiar set of positions written down:
Missionary on the sofa
Monkey in the bathroom sink
Doggy standing by the mirror
Flat on the belly
…
One card caught her attention. She held it in her hand and looked up at his dark chocolatey eyes:
“What is upside down spoons?”
He answered that he would be happy to show her, as a naughty smile flashed across his face. She loved that look in his eyes, and felt her inner works jump with emotion. It made her feel so wanted, and gave her goosebumps. He helped her off with her coat, and then her shoes.
He had actually helped dress her up before dinner. He liked doing that, and she knew it was a strange kink but she liked it. As she had been lying naked in bed he had gathered the clothes she had brought for the occasion. He had gotten her garter belt on first, then her black stockings. He had then wrapped her up in her short black dress, no bra. And had finished by pulling her panties up.
She liked it when he did that to her. It was a special feeling of being cared for, even if it meant that she had to help with the stockings and correct her dress as she was getting her make up done in the bathroom.
As they were walking to the restaurant she felt some of their mixed juices dripping from her. During dinner it was a constant reminder of their hard workout that afternoon.
They started kissing. Soft in the lips. Her hands busy unbuttoning his shirt. His hands pulling up her dress. She was enjoying the feeling of his warm touch on her. And his hurry to get his hands under her clothes to caress her bare skin. He pulled the zipper of her dress down and helped her out of it, as she opened his shirt and got her hands on his chest.
They also liked undressing each other. It felt as if they were unwrapping their presents. She put her hands up to help him get her out of her dress. As he pushed her dress above her boobs, she started caressing him with soft touches of her fingernails.
She fell back onto the bed as he started kissing her right nipple. She loved the way he circled its tip with his tongue, making it wet and slurping on it until it felt as if her whole boob was made out of stone. As he moved to her other breast she could also feel how he was getting rid of his shirt and trousers.
She liked to lie in bed and have him do things to her. She had told him before how she enjoyed giving up control to him. After he got her second nipple wet and hard he started cruising her body with his mouth. Discovering every inch of her, kiss by kiss. As he got to the bottom of her rib cage she felt how he was sucking harder on her. He was marking the path through her using hickeys instead of breadcrumbs.
She was still lying in bed with her hands up and her dress covering her face. In a way as if she were blindfolded, except that she could free herself at any time. She felt him going down past her belly button and proceeding to her panties.
Her panties were wet, as in extra wet. He removed them and started exploring her vulva with his mouth. He found a little concentrate of their juices at her entrance. It almost felt like candy. He got as much as he could on the tip of his tongue and moved up to kiss her. He had to move the dress above her head to place the sweet dessert he had found on her mouth. She giggled when she realized what it was. As he was freeing her from her dress she asked him:
“So what about that upside down spoons you wrote about?”
He winked at her and moved her onto her side, as if he was going to spoon her from behind. Except that he placed his head at her feet and his knees on her back. He was indeed upside down from her. He opened up one of her legs as she reached for his shaft. It only took a few strokes to have him ready to go in. She placed the tip at her entrance and he moved up her hips to place himself in position.
The visuals were fantastic. She was so wet that he slid all the way in at the first push. He was kissing her left leg and holding her by her waist. She liked seeing how his cock was moving in and out of her. He told her with a wicked smile:
“ Remember how I told you I wanted to see how you masturbate? Well, now is the time. Show me how you touch yourself when we are not together and you are missing me!”
He got her hand on top of her clit and she started her little number, with two fingertips going up and down on top of it. He was moving slowly in and out, as she reached to his shaft to get some of their juices on her fingertips. Her fingers continued the dancing routine, except that the intimate atmosphere had now been replaced by the voyeurism of feeling his stare on her.
This felt so extremely hot to him. He could see in her face what she was experiencing. Every now and then she flashed a smile at him and looked in his eyes. She still had her stockings and garter belt on, and the view of her fantastic body from his vantage point was something out of this world. He could see in her expression how she was concentrating on her orgasm.
Her fingers were doing the final strokes and she knew she would be over the edge soon. The slow in and out dance was helping her build up. She opened her mouth to tell him:
“I am about to come…”
And with a few more caresses she arched her back and released the next batch of energy. He parked his cock all the way inside of her and could feel her shaking surrounding him. He was looking at her, as a spectator who has been given access to a very private show. A show built up of their love, of their want of each other, and from the build up of the days that they had not been together.
They agreed that these are the moments worth living for.Don’t speak to me with words
Talk with lips on skin
Scream with fingers on my back
Send your messageWhen it came to anal stuff she was a virgin. He had not pushed for it because it was not a kink that he was particularly looking for. However he knew from experience that there were girls who really, really liked it. So as they were cuddling in bed he brought the topic up. She was curious but since she did not know what to expect she was in no hurry to try it.
He was giving her oral pleasure, his tongue making pirouettes together with her clit, her labia being their dancefloor. She had her legs on his shoulders and was enjoying the slow and steady build up of energy down there. He had one hand by her butt crack, and the fingers of the other one were caressing the outside of her vulva.
He placed his finger at her entrance. She was relaxed and welcoming the visitor. She moved her hips to accommodate a better angle and his finger just slid inside of her. He felt her cushioned inside, which was extremely wet. He moved his index finger all the way in, but it was not enough. His middle finger came to the rescue and both made it as deep as they could get.
His tongue was concentrating on her clit as he looked up at her. She was observing him with a look of pleasure in her eyes. He paused and asked her:
“Do you want me to try through the back door?”
“If you want…” was her answer. After the long loving session her labia were so engorged that he knew she would probably be quite receptive to his finger. He moved his fingers out and placed the tip of the index one at her back entrance. He started playfully drilling in with a circular motion as she started moving her hips to accommodate this new sensation.
After a few strokes the finger made it all the way inside. He kept stroking as her moaning increased. He was focusing on her clit again and could feel that her emotions were about to overflow. His whole mouth was covering her pearl and he was sucking firmly. Suddenly the walls of her thighs came tumbling down with a roar.
He had brought some avocado oil-based organic lube for them to experiment with. She was now riding him on top. They had melted together again and did not know where one ended and the other started. During one of her motions away, his shaft came out of her. She flashed a mischievous look at him and grabbed his manhood with her hand, while the other one reached for the lube.
She got enough liquid on him and started stroking his cock. It was thick, but she really wanted to try to fit him inside through the back door. She guided the tip in place and started pushing down. It was a new feeling. His finger had just slid inside without much effort, but this thing was major work.
She placed her hands on his pelvis and closed her eyes as she started pushing down in little steps. Her nerves down there were in overdrive as she could feel a bit of a pang with every push. Slowly she made way for him; the deeper it got, the easier it became.
He was looking at her beautiful figure on top of him. Her face framed by her beautiful hair. Her breasts like two flowers in full bloom. His hands on her hips, trying to provide her with some support. She opened her eyes to look at him, and he could feel her internal emotion in her expression.
She moved down to place a kiss on his mouth, and told him:
“Here you go, my anal virginity, a present for you!”When your demure, beautiful wife suddenly proposes an orgy, do you:
a. ask further questions such as why? where? when? eh?
b. blurt out yes and fuck any negative consequences along with other people?
c. become instantly suspicious that this is a psychological mind game and refuse on the sacred grounds of monogamy?
d. suggest attempting reverse wheelbarrow first, or a quickie in a restaurant before the main course?
e. slowly back away from the alien in front of you?
Answer: none of the above. I laughed and said, ‘you’re taking the piss.’ But no piss was being taken. My wife had stolen the eyes of a nympho in heat. She’d even done research and produced colour coded post-it notes (ground rules, pros and cons etc) on sheets of A4.
‘Ah want to do something crazy,’ she said. ‘Don’t you?’
‘How dae you know about an orgy?’
‘A mate of mines was telling me she goes to one her mate arranges. They’re in right now.’
‘What mate is this?’
‘You don’t know her. Ah met her at the gym.’ Question overload. Do you… fuck it.
‘Why not?’ This was me trying not to play it cool like I had a fluffer and an extremely glamorous monthly STD check. ‘If it’s something you want to try, let’s do it. Are you alright with me, you know, doing things with other women?’
‘Are you alright with me doing things with women?’
‘Aye. Ah think ah can live with that.’
‘What about guys?’
‘Ah don’t think am ready to fuck a guy; orgy or no orgy.’
‘Ah meant me.’ Just make out you’re fine with it. Think of the greater good.
We arrive at the orgy headquarters in a leafy suburb far removed from our flat. My wife’s friend of a friend is obviously in the highest council tax band. The lucky bastard. I already fear this will be a scene from the class struggle as I treat this house like a hotel and steal bathroom supplies I might not need.
The place is massive inside and everyone is a bit too friendly, but the drinks are flowing. I suppose that’s vital given the purpose of the visit. The wine makes me feel more comfortable or less panic-stricken as I watch people slowly disappear upstairs past strange erotic art that must be taken down when the family comes to visit. My wife’s doppelgänger asks me if I like the look of certain women. This has to be some sort of elaborate ploy to question my commitment to her. I am unenthusiastic and use nice safe words.
The designated fuck spots in the bedrooms upstairs are filling up. I am now half-drunk and full-horny. These feelings are added to pensive, suspicious, scared and oddly melancholic. A couple befriend us with inane getting to know each other questions. It’s all a bit normal and unorgy like — not that I’m an expert when it comes to the etiquette. I respectfully pretend I need to piss and explore upstairs where doors are shamelessly open; I can see flesh writhing on flesh and people ignoring the searing pain in their knees. I have a nice, long look and take it all in.
I return to my wife who is eager to get going before she loses her nerve. Ourselves and a few other unsure orgy virgins are left dotted around the downstairs area. We are now at the stage where upstairs with the tits and cocks at every turn seems much more relaxing.
‘You okay?’ my wife asks.
‘Aye, in the pink.’
‘Let’s go upstairs,’ she says.
My cock is still flaccid, but I cajole it into a semi by looking in a few of the bedrooms. A gym-sculpted naked woman comes to a door and leads my wife in by the hand. They kiss and leave me looking like a sad animal in an unimpressive zoo. My wife finally remembers she came with a husband and pulls me in. There’s a woman being spit-roasted and a couple masturbating like an American general has launched a preemptive strike on Moscow. My cock responds and quickly assumes complete domination of my feeble brain.
The cock is rapidly rubbered up and in the mouth of another woman. My socks are still on and so are my trousers, but I have dispensed with the top half, which is folded neatly in the corner — my wife’s work after I dumped the shirt at my feet. Why didn’t I take the rest of it off when I had the chance? Now it seems disrespectful to take my cock out of this stranger’s mouth. What’s the protocol here? Never mind. Here comes a dick with nothing but glasses on to masturbate way too close to me for comfort. That’s my cue to get the rest of my clothes off. The socks are a bit of a struggle but they come off without me falling on my arse. Result. I come back to resume my blowjob, but the dick has moved in on my territory. Now I really am a spare prick. I get down on my knees behind my wife and lick her wet pussy.
A masturbating woman in the corner is definitely a turn-on. My eyes focus on her to avoid the cock and arse of the dick standing far too near to my wife. She catches me ogling and makes her way over to put her pussy in my face while I fuck my wife. As Thursday nights go, this in the top ten weirdest. Another guy enters the fray and seems enamoured with my wife, but my cock is staying inside her until he fucks off. I am the orgy spoilsport.
After some rearranging of bodies and embarrassed guffaws, I’m subjected to my wife sucking another man’s cock. I grin and bear it with my cock inside a beautiful, dark-skinned woman, who is a bit theatrical and fond of a verbal barrage. Her demands for me to go harder and deeper draw a few looks from the rest of the shaggers around the room. Eventually I have to get out of her to fly under the radar and not prematurely cum.
I continue wading through a raging sea of pointless, amazing pussy and trying not to cum. Inevitably, I cannot think about enough disgusting stuff to stop myself; it simply has to done. Realising you’ve attracted an audience to watch you cum is a bit disconcerting once the insane wears off. If you’re like me, your sexual hang ups may suddenly bulldoze through paper thin walls like a puritanical Kool-Aid Man.
I am in a rush to leave and not make eye contact with those still participating, especially the ones who want you to linger and salivate like a subjugated dog in front of a demented psychiatrist. No thank you. No more dinner for me. I am full. My fuck-crazy doppelgänger sticks around for another ten minutes, while I think about how to get my real wife back from the black lodge until I’m hard again. Her only disappointment is the absence of cuddling. There’s no cuddling after an orgy; at least not at this one. We will make up for the lack of that once we get home. Kung Fu death grip cuddles are coming.Eric and Tessa had been together for two years. It was a long-distance love affair. They treasured the time that they could spend together. They enjoyed the regular day to day things in life but when they got together things tended to go to the extreme. They drank more and they had a lot of sex. One extended weekend they had together, Eric came eleven times. It was amazing they could both walk after that one. Eric had come out of a loveless marriage and Tessa had been on her own for a few years when they met. They found in each other the highly sexual person they had each been hoping to find.
The sex had been fantastic from the start. It had been surprising and exhilarating to find the ideal lover. He had introduced her to anal sex and to her surprise she enjoyed it a lot with him. She had done it before, but not the way he did it. He enjoyed the lead up and playing as much as the actual penetration. Maybe he was a little preoccupied with the ass but it worked for them.
They enjoyed the fact that they could talk about anything; open sexual communication was something they both wanted. They could explore anything, first in words and if they were both comfortable with it, they moved to the physical. They had been talking about having a threesome for months. The problem wasn’t bringing someone else into it, it was the matter of who it would be. Tessa wasn’t interested in other women. She had always said that she really didn’t care who was licking her pussy but she had no real desire to lick pussy herself. So they would have to find the right guy to join them.
There wasn’t anyone in her circle of friends that she would be interested in. She always kept the idea at the back of her mind when she met different people, wondering if they would be suitable. Eric did the same. He tended to meet more people in his line of work than she did. He thought it would be incredibly hot to watch her with another man. He knew how much she loved giving head and she did it so well; watching her give a blowjob would be hot.
Over the months there were people that they discussed. It wasn’t a high priority but it was fun to add the conversation into the mix when they were having sex. They talked about what she would do to the guy. He told her he wanted to see her giving a blowjob while he was fucking her. That played nicely into her fantasy since she really loved cock. She wanted more than one cock but she wasn’t sure double penetration would be her thing. Having a cock driving into her while she had one in her mouth would be fun.
They planned for her to go to his place for a long weekend. He had been getting some work done on his garage and he had become friendly with the contractor. He considered him a possibility and decided to arrange it so that Dan, the contractor, would come by the house while Tessa was there that weekend. Eric had tried to feel out Dan for a reaction to the possibility of a threesome. He wasn’t specific in case it wasn’t something he’d be interested in. Dan had not committed to anything but he didn’t shut Eric down either.
Eric told Tessa about it on the Friday after she had arrived. She was excited. She had given Eric her criteria for a guy and this one seemed to meet it. They would find out the next afternoon if their fantasy would become reality. That night they had incredible sex anticipating and talking about what could happen. The next day, they went about their regular morning routine. Tessa gave Eric a blow job to wake him up and he couldn’t help but want to put his big, hard cock inside her wet pussy. She always got so wet when she gave a blow job. He fucked her gently at first but then he turned her around and got her up on her knees so he could fuck her hard from behind. She loved it like that but because he was so big sometimes it was like he was actually pushing her forward with the intensity of his thrusts. No matter, she took him in and loved it when he filled her with his cum.
Later in the afternoon Dan came by to discuss some details for the finishing touches to the garage. Tessa checked him out and approved. After they finished their business, Eric invited him in for a few beers and they decided to order a pizza. It all seemed very casual and natural. The drinks continued to flow and as they were sitting around the table the conversation started to turn sexual. Tessa asked Dan what he enjoyed in a woman. He was a breast man and loved nipples. If they stood out, they were that much better to him. He loved squeezing them. He would get hard the harder he squeezed them. Well this was sounding very good to Tessa. She had great tits and her nipples were definitely outstanding and very sensitive!
Maybe it was the drinks but after another beer she grew bold and decided to get up from the table and walk over to Dan. They thought she was just going to the kitchen, but she stood beside him and pulled down her shirt and bra to show him her nipple. Eric smiled and although Dan was a little surprised he hardly skipped a beat as he just reached up and squeezed.
“Those are certainly great nipples,” he said as he squeezed her hard.
She let out a little moan. She had already discussed how she got wet instantly when her nipples were squeezed so both Eric and Dan knew what would happen to her. Dan quickly unleashed the other one and he was squeezing both of them. Well they knew Tessa was getting wet but they also knew that Dan would be getting hard. It wasn’t lost on Eric and sure enough his big cock started to rise. Dan pulled Tessa to him and took her breast into his mouth and bit down on the nipple. Ohhhh, that felt good.
Eric was getting really hard watching this initial contact. He wondered where things would go. Dan looked over to Eric to make sure he was okay with what was going on. Eric gave him a nod, it was fine, maybe even better than they could’ve anticipated. Neither Eric nor Tessa had figured out how things would start. This was working well.
Dan reached for Tessa’s crotch and felt the growing heat. That was all he needed to get his erection even harder. He unbuttoned her jeans and undid the zipper and quickly slid a finger into that wet pussy. Heaven. She was so wet already. She wasn’t kidding when she had said there was a direct connection from her nipples to her pussy.
Dan finger fucked her and she held his head hard to her breast, all while he was still biting her nipple. Eric had to unleash his beast. He undid his pants and brought out that beautiful cock and moved back from the table so that he could stroke it as he watched them. Tessa opened her eyes and locked them with Eric’s as she smiled at him. They hadn’t talked about exactly what would happen, they figured it would just happen, and it sure was. Eric smiled back at her, he was enjoying the show knowing that Dan was getting her so wet.
Dan knew what he could do to a woman, he had a trick up his sleeve and wanted to show them both. He pulled her jeans down further and started moving his fingers on her G-spot. That felt good but Tessa wasn’t ready for what happened next. Within two minutes of him starting, Tessa’s pleasure was building in intensity and her knees were getting weak. All of a sudden she was squirting. Dan quickly took her pants down further while still massaging her. He loved seeing a woman squirt and he knew he would get her going quickly.
Tessa had squirted before but it was usually when Eric had her propped up on the bathroom vanity. She always figured it was the position of his cock hitting her just right. She always felt spent in the best way after she squirted. This was the same feeling. After what seemed like a long time, but probably wasn’t, she needed to sit down. Dan had a big smile on his face and Eric was just surprised. He wanted to know how to do that.
“I can’t believe you got me going so quickly! I’ve never squirted standing up.”
“It’s all in the finger play.”
There was a big chair close by and Tessa went over and collapsed into it. What a feeling that had been. She had a big smile on her face. Eric came over to her and kissed her.
“What did you think of that? You enjoyed it?”
“Oh yes, how could I not?” she replied.
“You know what that did to me? It was fun watching, I want to try that on you but first I need to do something with this.” He was stroking his cock.
She smiled and reached out for his cock. It really was a great cock, to look at and to suck and to fuck. She wanted him inside her and she knew he would oblige. She spread her legs for him to get a feel of her. She was wet and he knelt to have a little taste and then stood up, picked her up and turned her around. He took her by the hips and slowly guided his hard cock into her pussy. He loved looking at her ass as he drove his hard shaft into her. After a couple of slow moves, he couldn’t help himself, he started going faster, he knew she loved it. They had a fantastic sex life, they were in sync and their sex drives were at the same level, very high.
Dan was watching from his chair at the table, it was a good view. He watched as Eric’s cock went in and out and enjoyed watching Tessa’s tits sway back and forth, she really did have great tits. He sat and stroked his cock, this was a good show.
Eric was loving the feel of Tessa’s wetness enveloping his cock. She had a nice tight pussy. He slid in and out easily. At one point he looked over at Dan and took a moment to watch him stroking his cock. The sight of Dan stroking his cock while watching them seemed to get his cock even harder. He slowed it down just a little. Dan gave an inquisitive look to Eric and Eric motioned him over. Dan cupped Tessa’s breast and rubbed her shoulder. She let out a purr and rolled her shoulders. The feeling of Dan’s hands on her and Eric’s cock in her was mind-blowing. It was about to get better.
Dan reached down to rub Tessa’s clit as Eric pumped into her. He also gave a feel to Eric’s balls as he moved in and out. It was such an electric sexual atmosphere, everything felt right. That touch added to Eric’s pleasure.
It wasn’t long before Tessa took Dan’s cock in her mouth and started to really go at him. This was the ultimate. She didn’t really want double penetration, but she sure wanted cock! She was very much in the moment, having cocks coming at her from two directions was fantastic. She devoured Dan’s cock. Eric’s excitement was building, watching Tessa so enthusiastically suck cock was really turning him on and making him so hard.
Dan was loving it. Watching Tessa suck his cock, watching Eric fuck her, it was a great show! They were all enjoying the moment, it just kept going and they were all being satisfied, what more could they ask for?
The visuals were getting the best of Eric, he could feel his orgasm building and building. Tessa sucking cock, the way her back arched and the way she was giving her ass to him. He grabbed her hips tighter and with his signature double pump and then a slight break in the action, he emptied himself into her and let out a wonderfully expressive groan and kept tight inside her.
Tessa broke away from Dan’s cock and enjoyed the sensation of Eric filling her, giving her all she wanted. Dan took a step back and leaned on the chair. He certainly hadn’t realized what was going to transpire when he had come by that afternoon. He couldn’t have been happier with the change of plans for the night.
Tessa moved over to the couch to spread out and relax. Eric came over to sit beside her while Dan went to the kitchen to get more beer, they could all use the refreshments. He sat down on the loveseat and smiled at all the visions that were going through his mind. He knew this wasn’t the end, it was only the beginning.
Soon the conversation turned back to squirting and Dan’s technique. Eric was really interested in how he managed to get a woman to go so quickly. Dan was showing him, he needed to move his fingers like he was motioning for someone to come over but do that with his middle finger as the main motion and his index following. Eric wanted to try it out.
“What do you think, baby, are you ready to go again?”
“I’m not sure, but I wouldn’t want to interfere with your education,” she said with a smile.
She stayed in place, laying on the couch, and spread her legs for them. Somehow this didn’t feel strange. She had only met Dan a couple of hours before but here she was, being his canvas and letting him play with her body. He couldn’t help but reach out for her nipples. They were like bullets and he couldn’t resist them. It didn’t hurt that the reaction of her pussy was almost simultaneous, getting those juices flowing. Eric put his fingers inside her but she wanted more than to just give them what they wanted. She asked that he put his tongue inside her and play with her clit. Eric did as requested and Dan looked on with a big smile on his face and his fingers still pinching her nipples. Now this was something new for her, having her man licking her pussy but having Dan there watching. Yes, she liked it and she locked eyes with Dan, giving him a wicked smile that got his cock hard.
She reached out and grabbed the waistband of his jeans and pulled him closer and started undoing his pants. She wanted cock. Eric was expertly playing with her pussy, she wanted a cock in her mouth. Dan happily obliged. He was already hard as she wrestled his cock out of his pants but as soon as she started playing with him he got bigger in her mouth. He wasn’t as big as Eric but he was still a good size. She took him all in and then started playing with his head. She knew many men liked when she rubbed her tongue at the base of the head on the ridge where the shaft met the head. She was getting him going, there was no doubt about that and Eric raised his head and smiled at her. He knew she enjoyed cock. She was full of sensation, Eric’s expert tongue on her clit and licking her pussy, Dan pinching her nipples and his cock in her mouth. She devoured the cock just as Eric was devouring her pussy. Dan put his head back and enjoyed it all.
With all this going on it didn’t take long for her orgasm to build and Eric knew it was coming. He slipped his fingers into her and got a good pace going. Soon she was holding his head to her pussy while she ground her hips into his face and with her other hand she held onto Dan’s cock. It was building and building and then with one last suck on her clit Eric took her over the edge and she released Dan’s cock and threw her head back and screamed. That was intense!
She had played with two men before but it hadn’t been like this. This time it was all about her. They wanted to please her, her orgasm was the goal and she got it. She lay back and smiled and curled up. Eric licked his fingers and wiped his face. He didn’t notice Dan watching him. Dan wanted some of that but realized it wasn’t the time yet. He hoped he’d have his turn tasting that pussy.
Eric got up to have a smoke on the deck. Tessa was still naked, curled up on the couch, practically purring like a kitten. Dan sat down next to her and started caressing her ass. She had a great body and the way she had reacted to them was thrilling. He kept rubbing her ass and then he couldn’t help himself, he slid two fingers into her. But he didn’t want to make her cum, he just wanted to touch her, to feel her wetness. He really wanted to taste her. He was slow and soft. She enjoyed it and so did he. He took his fingers out and she turned her head just as he put them into his mouth. She smiled. He slid them back in and was gentle. He just wanted to feel her and massage her. She didn’t mind at all, it felt quite nice to have that compared to the rush of the orgasm.
She was still so wet and he wanted to taste her but he knew she wasn’t quite ready for another orgasm. Her pussy had already had a lot of action and it was pretty intense. Eric came back and was a little surprised to see Dan with his fingers inside Tessa. He didn’t really think he could say much considering a few minutes before he had been watching her suck Dan’s cock. It just seemed like an intimate moment and he wasn’t sure how he felt about that.
Eric sat down in the side chair and watched as Dan continued to stroke and caress Tessa’s pussy. Soon he found himself getting hard again and he started rubbing his cock. Tessa had her eyes closed, she was just enjoying the sensations but then she opened them and noticed Eric getting his cock hard again.
“Don’t even think about it, I need a little break and this feels nice.”
“I’m just enjoying the visual,” he said as he continued to rub his cock through his jeans.
Dan was enjoying the dynamic. He could tell Tessa was relishing it all but he picked up on Eric’s hesitancy; he didn’t care. He figured he’d been invited into this play so he was going to enjoy himself too. Dan spread Tessa lips with one hand and with his other hand he slid a finger in. Again, he wasn’t going fast, just slow and steady, but she started moving her hips with his rhythm. She was getting into it. Eric pulled out his cock and started stroking it. A bit of pre-cum came out and he took it with his finger and tasted it.
Tessa was watching him. “Hey, that’s not fair. You should be sharing with me.” She always had a hard time resisting his cock when she saw it. Eric knew this. Dan continued to stroke her but smiled. Tessa reached out her hand toward Eric, wanting that cock. Eric got up and continued stroking his cock. He took the few steps toward her but he didn’t give her his cock right away. He stood just out of her reach and increased the speed of his stroke. Dan noticed that she started to get wetter so he increased his speed just a little bit. What he really wanted was to throw her onto her back and sink his face into her wet cunt but it wasn’t the time for that. She’d just had that. He figured he was using extra special restraint but she had such a pliable body and was so open to experiencing sensations that he was truly enjoying the sensation of his fingers inside her, what the whole experience was giving to her.
Eric continued his strokes for a few more seconds but he didn’t want to deny Tessa what she wanted, and he loved the feel of his cock in her mouth. He stepped to her and she opened her mouth for him. He went in as far as she could take. He kept a similar pace as Dan was doing with her pussy, slow and easy and very enjoyable. The point of playing wasn’t always to climax, sometimes it was great to feel the sensations and enjoy it for what it was. The whole night was the experience. To have a night filled with sexual experiences, a sexual feel to everything that happened. Sex was on the agenda and they wanted it, but sex can take on many forms.
She loved the feel of Eric’s cock in her mouth. He was bigger than most and she had a gag reflex so there was no way that she could take all of him in but that was ok, he never complained, how could he when the way she played with him gave him such pleasure. She was a master of the blowjob. The way she played with her tongue, how she changed pace and position, but it was her enjoyment and desire to give that was the best part of the blowjob. Sure, any guy likes getting a blowjob but when a woman gives with such enthusiasm, it’s not a job.
Tessa always made sure that she was in the moment and she got hot and very wet when she gave a blowjob. Knowing that what she was giving was making her man feel so good, that made her happy and want to give more. That’s why it was so good when she got feedback from her man. Moans and groans, motions, participation went a long way for her. Right now she had the attention of both men and she couldn’t be happier. It was all slow and easy and relaxed and full of sensation.
After a while, Eric pulled out and went out for another smoke. Dan licked his fingers and just relaxed. Tessa laid there and melted into the couch. She was enjoying the total relaxation that sexual satisfaction can bring. They turned the music up and just hung out for a bit.
Eric came back and they sat around just talking about regular stuff. If anyone walked in they would think there were just a group of friends hanging out for the night. But that wasn’t going to last. This was just an intermission.
Eric asked if anyone else wanted a beer and got up to go to the kitchen. Tessa followed Eric, she wanted to make sure he was ok with everything that was going on. He reached into the fridge and as he turned around she was there. She kissed him deeply and he responded. He had no problem with what had been going on. It wasn’t the norm, but he was enjoying it and he knew she was too, that was very important. He took her in his arms and really kissed her.
They held the embrace and enjoyed the moment.
Dan was wondering why his beer was taking so long so he came into the kitchen to get it himself. He saw Eric and Tessa together and took a quick step back but stopped and watched. Neither of them had heard him come around the corner but it was interesting to watch them kiss. They devoured each other in a very intimate way. That was just between them.
“What’s a guy gotta do to get a beer around here?”
They slowly parted. Dan wasn’t an interruption for Tessa, he was an addition. She looked from Eric to Dan and then down to their pants. She took hold of their waistbands and pulled them both towards her. She knelt and smiled up at them as she started undoing buttons. They helped getting themselves free and ready for her. She took one look up at them and then she looked at both cocks in front of her and dove in. Two really good cocks ready for her, a very good thing.
She took Eric first and got him wet and then did the same to Dan. She worked them both, she hoped she could get one to cum and the other would follow, she’d take as much as she could. She had never given two blowjobs at once. She’d watched porn of course but it was a little different to have both presented to her. They both started to grow harder, they were enjoying this and so was she. Tessa went a little faster, she switched between them, she always had her hands on them. She was trying to pump Dan while she went down and sucked on Eric’s balls, she knew how he enjoyed when she mixed things up. He threw back his head and let out a low, loud moan. Dan seemed to get harder with that.
Well she couldn’t leave Dan out of the mix, she went back to him and took his balls in her mouth. Yes, Dan understood why Eric moaned. This was feeling fantastic and knowing that she was excited and enthused to have both, it made it so much better. She kept going on them, switching up, and then at one point she took both hard cocks into her mouth. She was surprised she could get her mouth wide enough but wow, what a feeling to get them both.
Cock, all cock. She was excited and very much in the moment. She felt in control. Sure, they were the ones with the hard cocks but she was orchestrating it and controlling it. That was a heady feeling. She went with it and made sure they were enjoying the sensations. She knew she was. This night had been more than she could’ve imagined.
She noticed that Eric was grinding just a little bit faster. Her moans grew louder as she felt him responding to her. She knew it added to the experience for Eric to have Dan there, to be standing next to each other, two hard cocks. Guys were usually competitive but this wasn’t like that, they were all enjoying the pure, raw sexuality that had taken over for them all.
She wanted to take him down but she didn’t want to leave Dan out. This was her chance to have both men cumming on her tits, she’d take what she could in her mouth but she wanted them all over her tits too. After all it wasn’t all about them, she was going to get what she wanted. Rubbing warm cum all over her chest was so decadent to her, she loved the feeling.
Tessa had Eric in her mouth and pumping Dan hard with her hand. Who would be the first to cum? She was pretty sure they were both getting close. She switched over to Dan for a moment and Eric took his own cock in his hand. She kept her eye on Eric so she would know when to open for him. It didn’t take long, he started to moan and since Dan wasn’t cumming yet, she came off him and opened her mouth wide for Eric to shoot right into her.
The sight of Eric cumming and Tessa’s hand on his cock was all it took for Dan to follow suit. He took his cock back and gave the last few pumps as he watched Eric’s white cum shoot right into Tessa’s mouth. He aimed for her chest but Tessa saw what was happening and quickly turned to capture some of him in her mouth as well. Eric continued to cum on her chest. When her mouth was full she lifted her chin and Dan finished off on her chest.
She looked up at them and opened her mouth to show them both and sure enough some cum came out to trickle down her chin. She smiled and drank them down as she started to smear them together across her tits. The warmth of them made her nipples hard. It couldn’t have turned out better.
She licked the last drop from her lip and sat back on her heels. Oh yes, this was a fucking memorable night. The feel of their hands on and in her body, her breasts, her skin and her clit, to be finished off by their hot cum spread over her. A night that would not be forgotten.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.
Find more refined stories of lust at MyErotica.com.My Master had taken me out to a pretentious event earlier that evening. Now, back at his place, we could finally be ourselves. His dungeon was my palace and I was his princess.
I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.
Follow MyErotica for refined erotic fiction to ignite your deepest desires.Shallow breaths
As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
HeThe first time, I was pretty sure I was seeing things. I was in my towel, fresh out the shower, ready to pick my undies before heading out for my uni class in town. Deciding what to wear, I had this vague, mostly subconscious sense that my bras and panties weren’t quite laid out how they were the previous morning.
The second time, I was convinced someone had been in my panty drawer. Some of my panties and thongs we definitely not arranged how I’d left them.
I felt pissed. Which of my housemates was going through my personal stuff? There were five of us living together. Two girls, three guys. None of them seemed the sort who’d go through my lingerie. Then again: how would I know?
The third time I caught him. Sat on my bed, with my favorite black lace panties wrapped around his cock. He was pumping himself hard and fast.
“What the fuck, James?” I said angrily, turning on the light.
“Shit,” was all he managed. And then again: “Shit.”
I’ve never seen anyone look so panicked. Deer in the headlights didn’t come close to it.
He took my panties off his cock, left them on my bed, and zipped himself back up. Then, unable to look me in the eyes, he walked straight past me, head down, and up to his top floor bedroom.
Two hours later I was lying in bed, unable to sleep.
The anger had subsided. Bizarrely, the initial feelings of violation had now turned to intrigue.
I’d never thought of any of my housemates as anything but friends. And now suddenly I couldn’t help but think about James differently.
He was into me.
My thoughts lingered for a moment on seeing his cock.
Out of nowhere, I felt a slight shudder of pleasure go through me thinking about my sexiest panties wrapped around it. Without even realizing, my hand had slipped down between my legs.
What was I thinking? I was shocked at myself. I wanted to feel angry again. That was the normal response I should be having. Right? But I couldn’t get the anger back. Suddenly the whole thing felt thrilling.
Before I could stop myself, I picked up my phone. And I texted him.
“Next time, just ask, okay?”
My heart was racing. What was I doing? I felt instant regret.
Then I heard my phone beep.
“Next time?”
Out of nowhere I felt this longing to see his cock again. With my panties wrapped around it. I wanted to watch him do it.
“How about now?” I wrote impulsively.
“?” he replied instantly.
Did I really want to do this? What was I getting myself into?
Fuck it, I thought.
“Come down and play with my panties again…while I watch,” I texted.
My left hand was rubbing my clit through my panties as I typed on the phone with my right. I hadn’t felt turned on like this in ages. Maybe never quite like this.
My phone beeped again.
“Are you serious?”
I found myself getting almost annoyed at his hesitancy, firing off an instant reply.
“Yes! Now get the fuck down here already.”
I heard the floorboards creak. His room was directly above mine. And then his slow footsteps down the stairs. He knocked gently on my door. Walked in, smiling sheepishly.
He didn’t know what to say.
“I want to watch you jerk off in my panties,” I told him, suddenly feeling bold in a way that surprised me.
I lifted the bedcover off and moved so I was sitting on top of it instead. I indicated for him to come and sit next to me. He was still fully dressed and clearly nervous. I found it quite endearing. And it made me want to take charge like I never had before.
“Take your jeans and boxers off,” I told him.
He could hardly look at me, but did it immediately. I smiled when I saw his cock. So big and hard. Maybe he was nervous, but he was as turned on as I was.
“Now take my panties off for me.”
He looked at me, stunned. I could tell he was about to come out with this ‘are you serious’ line again, so I didn’t let him.
“Yes, I’m serious. Take them off. I want you to use these when you jerk off.”
I knelt up. He moved towards me. He slid his hands up the outside of my thighs, under my short nightdress, and up to my black panties. Yes, the ones I’d caught him playing with before.
Feeling his hands on me was mesmerizing. It was tempting to just have sex. But I was determined to watch him play with himself in my panties.
He peeled my panties off me. Instinctively he moved them straight to his face. I totally got off on watching him sniff my panties. I’d never even thought about anything like this and now it was driving my imagination wild.
Then he took my panties and, while looking into my eyes, wrapped them around his oh-so-delicious looking cock.
Instantly he let out a quiet moan as he touched himself for the first time.
I felt so wet that I was sure I was dripping.
I watched him rub himself slowly with my panties. I wasn’t even sure why this was such a turn on. But it was.
I sat on my bed, back to the wall, and parted my legs. I began to play with myself as he sat on the side of my bed rubbing himself harder and faster.
When he turned and saw me, his eyes widened.
“Fuuuucck,” I heard him whisper.
I could tell he was about to come soon.
I was desperate to see him come all over my panties. I don’t even know why. But I wanted it so badly. Needed it.
And then he did.
His body convulsed in front of me. And I watched as he came, covering my panties. I felt myself getting close to my own orgasm now too.
Another thought flashed into my mind.
“Lick my panties,” I told him. “I want to watch you lick your own cum out of my panties.”
James was so turned on he would have done anything.
And he did.
I watched him lick my panties, feeling more aroused than ever in my life.
“Now come and lick me.”
He didn’t hesitate. He lay between my legs, and moved his mouth to my pussy. I grabbed his head, pulling him tight towards me.
It didn’t take long. I was ready. Barely a minute after his tongue moved around my clit, I was ready to explode.
I squirted all over his face.
I’d never squirted before.I expect my Master soon
and knowing His pleasures, I must
prepare myself for His arrival.
I see myself reflected,
corsetted tight and waist nipped in
black, the way He wants me.
I look to check that
seams are straight and too high heels that
thrust my body into provocation.
I scent the room and
light soft candles, making shadows play upon
the body that will be His to use.
I find His ballgag and
part my lips to take it deep, and tighten the strap
so my cheeks bulge with violation.
I ensure His whip is hanging
where He may reach it when need arouses
and mark me in ways He pleases.
I caress the steel of cuffs
between my fingers, wanting to see them
glittering against yielding skin.
I feel compulsion in His iron bed
that will welcome my spread-eagled body
each shackle open with invitation.
I reach down to encircle ankles
to hear the sound of metal closing
moistening me wide for surrender.
I strain above my head to reach the bars
stretched tight is the way He wants me, I must
tighten steel upon my wrists.
I am here for Him now
knowing not when He will come, only that desire
will grow with the waiting.
I can only stare upwards
knowing that when He comes,
I will be only His.
101 Poems for kinky lovers, by Francesca Anderssen is available in paperback and on the Amazon kindle marketplace.Take me as your very own
tie me as your love demands
use me now and use me fully
force me down to your commands
I need to know your chains upon me
such craving there will always be
to want your ropes to hurt my body
so your bonds will set me free
Submission is my total needing
wanting you to make it so
taking me to places strangely
where I cannot help but go
You’re the one who now must hold me
I’ve sold myself to your control
with my freedom gone forever
now that you possess my soul
So tie me tighter yet and tighter
my screams must bite the gag you give
use my mind to make me suffer
this is how I want to live.

Mimi Bordeaux
Nov 7, 2016
Audrey is sitting in a cocktail lounge. She’s sipping her Cosmo, thinking to herself, ‘I deserve a night out. I work hard. It will be nice to enjoy a few drinks.’ She’s happy with her attire and looks elegant. She’s wearing a little black dress with a strand of pearls and her hair is tied up in a French roll.
A plain looking girl enters the bar. She never goes to bars but tonight she’s decided to be adventurous as it’s a warm summer evening. As she walks in she looks around nervously for an empty table. She is thinking, ‘I want to have an encounter… with anyone.’ She has never been in a proper relationship and at 26 she thinks it’s time.
She’s ordering her drink at the bar — a Shirley Temple — when she notices the elegant woman sitting there. Audrey is lost in her own thoughts, but her interest is piqued by Jane’s request for the non-alcoholic drink. She swings her bar stool around to look at her.
Jane summons up the courage to blurt out, “Oh hello… do you come here often?” She feels like a fool for her clichéd opening gambit, but she continues anyway. “I don’t usually go to bars, but here I am.”
Audrey coolly replies, “I like to go out alone and have a few drinks by myself.” She looks Jane up and down, notices that she’s actually rather sweet looking despite her plain clothes, senses her air of barely contained excitement. Her tone becomes warmer. “It’s quite dull here actually. How about you come back to my place and tell me all about yourself?”
“There’s not much to tell,” Jane says nervously, but before she really knows what’s happening she’s agreed to go back to Audrey’s place anyway.
It’s not far by taxi to Audrey’s luxurious apartment. ‘Oh, this is exciting!’ Jane thinks to herself. She still lives with her mother in an ordinary suburban house. Audrey offers her a drink and tells her to make herself comfortable, while she gets changed. She disappears through the double doors leading to her bedroom. Jane looks around; she’s never seen such opulence and she thinks Audrey must be very worldly.
Audrey returns. She has been busy putting on her outfit. She stands there, imposing, looking even taller in fishnet stockings and thigh high leather boots with spike heels. Her black corset barely contains her voluptuous breasts. She is wearing a dog collar around her neck and a black leather mask. She holds a black whip which she flicks every second.
She stares at Jane and says, “Go through that door,” gesturing towards a red leather door off the bedroom with the whip. Jane’s heart is racing. She’s apprehensive but excited by Audrey’s domineering tone. She does as she’s told and enters the room with Audrey following, flicking the whip at her behind. First softly, then a hard crack that stings Jane’s buttocks.
Jane perches on a stool in the middle of the room, the only place to sit, and glances around at her surroundings. Chains, ropes and leather straps hang from the ceiling and walls. She shivers at the sight.
Audrey slams the door shut and barks, “Did I give you permission to sit down?” Jane is confused. Audrey walks toward her, flicking the whip, and stands over her. “Open your legs.” Jane does as she’s told. “Are you getting wet? You must be excited.” Jane squirms, feeling wetness between the tops of her thighs. She’s never felt this way before. There’s a tingling sensation she can’t fathom. It’s because of Audrey.
Jane looks up. Audrey is staring at her and in a second has Jane’s head in her hands. She swipes her tongue up Jane’s cheek then to her mouth, biting hard on the lower lip. She rolls her tongue around Jane’s lips and forcefully enters her mouth, her tongue pushing in deep, grabbing onto Jane’s tongue with her teeth.
Audrey kneels, pulls Jane’s skirt and panties off and moves her head between Jane’s legs. Jane is quivering and needs to hold onto something but there’s nothing except Audrey. She puts her hands on Audrey’s head, winds her fingers into the elegantly coiffured hair. Audrey licks all the way from Jane’s asshole to her clit. She sticks her tongue in Jane’s cunt. In out, in out. She does it over and over again, licking Jane’s whole crack and tongue-fucking her deeper and deeper. Then she focuses on Jane’s clit, licking more softly.
Jane is overwhelmed by the attention and instinctively opens her legs wider. Audrey sucks and nibbles on her swollen clit, licking voraciously. Jane’s head is swimming, she thinks she may faint and her legs are trembling uncontrollably. There’s a fluttering in her stomach like an eel spinning around. She’s sweating, her chest is burning and her face is flushed. She’s on the verge of something, a sensation she’s never felt before. It’s building up from her toes, up her legs; between them she feels a gush of fluid. Suddenly she throws her head back, straining, her eyes tight shut; she grabs Audrey’s head and makes a high-pitched involuntary screech. She can’t think, see or hear any more, but she’s screaming out her pleasure as she slides off the stool.
“Shut up!” Audrey says harshly, pulling her to her feet and leading her by the neck to some ropes hanging from the ceiling. She ties Jane’s hands tightly and tells her to bend over. Jane is giddy, but she does as she’s told. There’s a sound behind her, then she feels something touching her cunt. It thrusts inside her, going right to the hilt, then out again. It goes in again and starts to move slowly, in out, in out. Jane moans as the thrusting becomes more intense.
Now it’s moving more quickly, sending waves of heat up Jane’s body. She moans and whispers, “Yes… oh yes!” as Audrey pumps her cunt with force. Audrey slams the dildo in, pressing at a special spot that has Jane intoxicated. Jane can’t hold back any longer and yells out, clutching at the rope, sweat dripping from her forehead, her cunt soaking wet and squirting juices that dribble down her thighs.
Audrey turns Jane around and thrusts the dildo into her mouth, making her gag for a moment before she adjusts to its size. “Suck!” says Audrey sternly. The dildo is coated with cum and Jane tastes her own juice for the first time.
Audrey unties Jane’s wrists and buckles a dog collar around her neck, with a short leash attached. She leads her to a wooden table. “Bend over and put your ass in the air, slut,” she commands her. The words have an instant effect on Jane, who feels her cunt swell and throb, more wetness trickling down her thighs. She’s so turned on.
Audrey holds onto the leash and rubs her finger against Jane’s asshole. Jane feels something cold and sticky being spread over her, and then Audrey’s fingertip wriggling into her ass. It feels strange, but good. The finger goes a little deeper, and then suddenly thrusts all the way inside. She yells.
“Shut up, slut,” Audrey says, adding a second finger and pumping them in and out of Jane’s ass. Jane lies flat against the table, ass up, and takes it. She starts to like it. She moans with each stroke.
“You like that do you, my little slut?” Audrey says, going deeper and faster. Jane is dizzy with excitement, growling and howling. Her orgasm fires through her whole body, radiating out from her core.
After a few minutes Audrey withdraws her fingers and Jane slumps down onto the table, exhausted. Audrey grabs the leash, making Jane stand, then removes the collar. She stares at Jane. She grabs her head and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck, then kisses her on the mouth.
“Time for you to go home,” she says. “You know the way out.” She marches Jane to the red door and pushes her through it, throwing her clothes after her. Jane dresses rapidly and staggers to the front door. Her pussy and ass are throbbing as she runs down the stairs. She’s floating. She feels like a bird in flight. She begins to walk.This girl looks exactly like me. The same long, wavy blonde hair. The same blue-grey eyes, the sprinkling of freckles over the bridge of her nose. The same slender fingers, moving to my nipple, as mine move to hers. We could be twins.
Only the tattoo on my back and the one on her foot mark us apart. She laughs when she undresses me and sees mine.
“Maybe I need to get one like it,” she says, getting down on her knees to kiss it, lick it; her tongue moving lower, down the cleft of my ass.
We met earlier that night, in a bar.
Coming face to face, I think for a moment that I’m walking into a mirror. We stare at each other for a long while, fascinated.
Before long we’ve both ditched our dates and are huddled in a corner, insulated from the noise of the bar by our absorption in each other. We’re drunk on the sight of each other, cataloguing the myriad points on which we are the same and the few tiny differences, obsessively.
“You’re just like me,” we keep telling each other.
When she asks my name and I say, ‘Narcisse,’ she laughs delightedly, getting the reference at once: Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection and died for love of himself.
She tells me hers is ‘Belle,’ which I know means beautiful; I’m not sure whether or not she’s lying but I like the inference, so I call her Belle anyway.
A little later and we’re sitting so close she’s practically on my lap, kissing avidly.
“Bet you’d fuck yourself if you could, wouldn’t you?” she says.
“Of course I would. Wouldn’t you?” She nods, unabashed. “Want to find out what it feels like?”
She nods again, runs a fingertip up my thigh as she leans in to whisper, “Your place or mine?”
My place then, the bedroom lights blazing so we can see every minute detail of each other as we undress, touch, explore. Every inch of her body looks strangely familiar. I lick each smooth expanse of skin as I uncover it, mapping the territory as I go, noting each hair and freckle. She shivers with arousal as I kiss her neck and then on downward, cupping a breast and sucking the nipple; she moans and I feel it harden against my tongue. Her responsiveness pleases me and my own nipples stiffen in sympathy, as if what I’m doing to her is physically mirrored in my own trembling flesh. I suck harder, my hands encircling her waist and running down over her hips.
I kiss and lick my way down her taut stomach, feeling it ripple at my light touch, then slide her panties down to her thighs and gaze at her pussy, enthralled. A neat tuft of blonde curls crowns her smooth, plump-lipped cunt. It’s like looking at myself from an angle I’ve never experienced before. I stare and stare until the intensity makes her fidget and she breaks the spell by pulling me onto the bed, breathless and flushed.
“What do you like?” she asks; meaning: how shall I get you off?
“You know what I like,” I reply, meaning: we’re the same. I like what you like.
Turns out I’m both right and wrong. She starts out gentle and teasing, kissing and licking around the edge of my skimpy panties, sucking my inner thigh, then licking me through the thin fabric until I’m dripping. By the time she peels my panties off and skims a fingertip along the slippery groove between my lips, I’m fighting the urge to tell her faster, harder, fuck me now! But it seems the teasing is what I wanted after all. Her touch is insistent, hypnotic, a slow build to a long drawn-out orgasm that has me screaming when she finally lets me come with three fingers plunging into my drenched hole and her lips suctioned around my clit.
I roll her onto her back and straddle her, kissing her insatiably, licking my cream from her lips. Pulling back to look into her eyes, I’m giddy with lust. For one vertiginous moment I feel as if I’m falling into a mirror, fucking myself into insanity.
Now all I can think about is tasting her. I spin around into a sixty-nine so I can hover my pussy over her face, too sensitive from my orgasm for much contact but shivering with arousal as she flicks her tongue delicately over my folds. My approach is more direct, more brutal; she’s shown me how she likes to be touched and now I’m teaching her my way. Spreading her open with my fingers, I swipe my tongue across her clit, over and over, relentless. My elbows pin her knees apart, my weight pinioning her so however much she squirms, she can’t escape the overpowering sensations. When she’s moaning and babbling deliriously, her hips juddering as she tries to hump up against my tongue, I thrust two fingers from each hand inside her, stretching her open and curling them to seek out her G-spot. Her hips buck so hard she nearly throws me off her as she comes, soaking my hands. She tastes just like me and that thought, coupled with the way she sucks fiercely at my cunt as she loses it, makes me come again.
We lie facing each other, and gaze into each other’s eyes, absorbing this information, the new things we’ve learned about ourselves from each other.
“I never knew I could come like that,” she says, wonderingly.
“I never knew I liked to be teased so much,” I laugh. She reaches for me again, kissing me hard as she slides one leg between my thighs, hooking the other over my hip. A little shuffling and we’re grinding together, pussy to pussy, both so hot and wet. There’s just enough friction to drive me out of my mind, my clit throbbing as I rub against her, hips moving in tight circles. This time, coming feels like hurtling down a long, dark tunnel into an explosion of light. I don’t know if the hammering against my chest is her heart or mine. The sense of consummation is profound.
We’ve been kissing and fingering, licking and sucking and fucking each other for so many hours it’s daylight when we finally disengage, blissed out and exhausted.
“Can I see you again,” she asks.
“You’ll see me every time you look in the mirror,” I reply.Watching your wife get fucked by another man is a real thrill, there is no doubt about that. But there are some cucks who want to take it even further. How can you go further than fucking? Cucks like me, we don’t just want our wives to cheat on us with their bodies. What we long for, more than anything else, is for our wives to develop real feelings for the bull.
It is called emotional cuckoldry. And it is not for the faint of heart. It is for people who are willing to really test their own inner strength. Maybe you suspect that it would be nice to watch your wife falling for another. I mean, it brings the excitement of competition to the surface, after all. But then, your heart gets kind of stamped on as she reveals to you the truth — that not only does he have a bigger cock than you, but he has also managed to awaken a real heart connection in her. Yes, that’s exciting too. But it is also incredibly scary. It means she might leave you.
And this is the real juice.
We emotional cuckolds must have had some abandonment issues in the past. And this fear of abandonment somehow is fused in our psyche with eroticism. So when the idea that our wife might leave first presents itself, the lump we feel in our throat is like nothing else. It unearths a desire and an excitement in us that is reckless — almost unlawful. Certainly taboo. We are not supposed to enjoy this. We must be masochistic, though, because we do. It hurts so good. So good.
It first happened to me with Ben, a guy that my wife had started fooling around with at work.
I knew she had a crush on him, that much she had confessed to me. But she hadn’t told me any of the details. I had assured her it was OK for her to pursue this crush, but she didn’t trust me, I guess. But finally, we had a date night, planned a week in advance, and I was able to get some of the details out of her.
It was dinner at The Corner Place, our favorite casual but awesome Italian. I waited until we had both ordered and had sipped a little red wine. Then I hit her with it.
“So, Lexy,” I said. “I’ve known you for a long time. You know, three years before we even started dating. Three years of dating. One year of marriage. That’s seven years.”
“Uh huh. Good math skills.”
She’s funny, I’ll give her that.
“I know you honey,” I said. “You can’t, you know…”
“I can’t what?”
“Well, I know you. And I would know if you weren’t, you know, telling me everything…”
“Oh, can we not talk about Ben tonight,” she said. “Can we just have a date night, me and you. Without Ben.”
“Of course.”
Shut down.
She shut me right down. Now I had to sit with these feelings. She was totally cheating on me. I mean, I knew she was cheating on me. But even this, being totally cheated on by the person who was cheating on me, by her withholding the details. Even this, I loved it.
It was a tortuous but lovely feeling.
We got through the whole date night. Got in bed, and I started making love to her. And as I was going down on her, I said, “Mmm, this tastes so good.” And then I just coyly asked her, “Has Ben tasted how good this tastes?”
“Mmmhmmm,” she murmured.
“I’m sorry,” I said, between licks of her clit. “Was that a yes?”
“Mmmmhmm,” she said.
“When did the lucky boy taste that?” I said, coming up for air.
“A couple days ago,” she gasped; she was almost ready to climax now. “We went back to his apartment at lunch. He wanted to fuck me. But I couldn’t.”
“So he just ate you,” I said.
“Mmmhmmm.”
“Did you cum?”
“Mmmhmmm.”
“And…”
“Oh shut up, I’m going to cum!”
And I concentrated on my work and made her cum real well. Then she went down and started reciprocating on my cock.
“Ah, and has Ben been as lucky as me in this regard?” I asked.
“Oh Jesus,” she said. “I’m trying to suck a dick here. Are you going to interrogate me or do you want a blow job?”
“Just nod or shake your head. Have you sucked his dick?”
She nodded.
I felt so good then. We were complete again. We weren’t holding anything back.
“Was it a nice dick?”
She shrugged her shoulders, then she nodded. I guessed it was a pretty nice dick.
“Bigger or smaller than mine?”
She made a kind of sing-songy noise. I didn’t hear it at first. But when she repeated it, I took her to be sing-songing “a little bigger.”
“A little bigger?”
She nodded.
“That’s good. That’s very good.”
It was so good in fact that I shot my load right then.
She was pissed.
“Josh!” she said. “I wanted to get fucked! I really wanted you to fuck me on our date night. Damn it.”
She got in bed next to me. But she wasn’t the one who should be pissed. It was her fault. She’d never told me this. And then, to find it out this way, through my subterfuge, it was all so exciting, I couldn’t help myself when I finally saw her nodding and admitting to a blow job. I just came like crazy.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” I said, finally asking the question that had been hanging between us.
“I’m sorry honey,” she said. “I just…I just didn’t feel like…you know, going through the details…I wanted it to be something…private, between me and Ben. Just this one private thing. I mean, I think that’s all it’s ever going to be. I don’t think I can bring myself to fuck him. So he ate my pussy and he made me cum and I sucked his cock and I made him cum, but–”
“Did he cum in your mouth?”
“See,” she said.
“See what?”
“This! I mean, I thought we could do this, Josh. I thought you could be…cooler about it. But maybe you can’t…handle it, I don’t know. I am going to call the whole thing off.”
“No! I can handle it!” I panicked. I was anxious that she was going to call the whole thing off. That was the last thing I wanted. “I don’t want you to call it off.”
It was then that she just broke down crying like crazy. I thought it was all my fault.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” I said to her. But through her blubbering, I gathered that it wasn’t my fault.
“What is it, then?” I asked.
“Oh, Josh,” she said. “I am so sorry. But…I think I’m falling in love with him. I’m sorry!”
“In love with Ben?”
“Yes,” she cried. “I’ve had a crush on him for months, yes. But now that we have been fooling around, Josh, I feel different with him, to how I feel with you. I’m so sorry. I feel…in my heart for him, something that I guess I didn’t know was there. But I think that’s what you’re supposed to feel in your heart for someone you fuck. I guess I shouldn’t have married you because I don’t feel that in my heart for you. I am so sorry. Oh God, I am so sorry about this. But it’s been driving me crazy and I’ve just got to be honest and tell you.”
“Tell me what?” I asked.
“I don’t love you, Josh,” she said, through a river of tears. “I’m sorry, I just don’t!”
When I woke up, she was packing a bag.
“What?” I said. “What are you doing?”
“What do you think I’m doing? Did you not hear what I told you last night? Were you drunk?”
“No,” I said. “I heard everything.”
“Then you know, that’s why I’m packing. I don’t love you, Josh. I’ve got to move out.”
“No you don’t,” I said. “That’s the last thing I want.”
“Right. You want to be married to someone who doesn’t love you? How fucked up is that?”
“Well, you might think it’s fucked up,” I said. “But Lexy, you know…it’s perfect for me. In so many ways. I mean, you know my upbringing…you know what I’m used to. My family didn’t love me. They didn’t even want me. So this is exactly what I’m comfortable with. I am just glad that it’s finally out in the open. I mean, you don’t think I knew that you didn’t love me? I mean, on our wedding day you were practically making out with Srivanda out on the balcony. I saw that, you know? The reason I picked you, unconsciously or consciously, must be because I have never felt loved and I wanted to continue that with my adult family.”
“So you want to stay with me, even though I don’t love you?”
She looked at me in disbelief.
“Yes,” I cried. “I love you more than ever now. This is what I want. Unrequited love. I want to suffer. I love it.”
“You love it.”
“Oh my God, if I could somehow let you experience what I experienced last night when you confessed this all to me. If you had been able to feel my chest, the compressions there. It was so intense. And then the back of my throat. It was such a pressure. And in my balls and my cock. I started almost cumming in my pants as you detailed how much you had been faking it, and how you really didn’t love me at all. It was so intense. It was painful and for some reason, the most pleasant feeling I have ever felt. After you went to sleep last night I went to the bathroom and I beat off ten times, I was so horny. Looking at you now, I think I’m going to cum again, just seeing your loveliness, and knowing that you don’t want me — it gives you an unbelievable power, don’t you see. You’ve become…Cleopatra. Royal. Beautiful beyond belief. You’ve become divine. A Goddess I can serve, but never equal. You’ve become…my dream come true.”
She looked at me like I was totally out of my mind.
“Wow, she said. “I did not…expect that.”
She put down her bags.
“So you want me to stay?”
“Yes!” I said. “Please stay.”
“Alright,” she said, looking bewildered. “I’ll stay. For now anyhow.”
And that’s how I became an emotional cuckold. My wife didn’t tell me details about her sex with her boyfriend any more. She shared details about her emotional connection with him. How he made her feel all girlie and excited. She took me shopping when she wanted to buy him a special gift. She wrote me emails and even handwritten letters about what a crush she had on him, how sexy he was, and how wonderful and special a person he was. She drew little hearts. She put her name and his name inside the heart. She took loads of special selfies of the two of them hugging and she sent them all to me. She shared herself and her affair with me totally. Even more than totally. I had the feeling that she was exaggerating a lot of it just because she understood me so perfectly. She knew that the worse she made it for me, the more jealous and shut out I felt, the more excited I got. And she took me there. All the way. She gave me the ultimate thrill. She made me into an emotional cuckold.
My wife. I love her so!I’m walking behind this girl in skintight yoga pants as she leaves the gym, watching her ass shimmy with every step she takes. I’m so mesmerized by the ripple effect that I barely even notice where I’m going. Does my ass jiggle like that when I walk? I can hardly grab it in the street to find out, but it doesn’t feel like it does. Now I’d like to grab her ass and feel her flesh bounce and shake as she sits on my face…
She goes into a coffee shop, and I follow, suddenly seized by a craving for caffeine (and pussy). She sits at a table by the window, catches my eye and smiles invitingly. I’m surprised I don’t recognize her — I thought I knew all the hot girls at my gym — but when I ask if I can join her, the effusive response makes it clear she’s noticed me before.
The morning’s progression is no less enjoyable for being entirely predictable. I’m in my comfort zone here, seducing cute girls being one of my favorite pastimes. Another coffee? Flirtatious chat. Her hand brushes my thigh as she leans across me to reach for the sugar, and she lets it linger there for a moment. Lunch? She lives nearby, she could make us something to eat…
I’ve been looking forward to peeling down those tight yoga pants, but as soon as we get inside her apartment she gives me a quick, promising kiss on the lips, and tells me she wants my opinion on her new outfit. She disappears into the bedroom, leaving me tingling pleasurably with anticipation; and returns a few moments later looking like a walking wet dream. Black lace lingerie, lace-topped stockings, garter belt, high heels; it might be a cliché, but it suits her hourglass figure perfectly. The panties cup her pussy so snugly I can see the hint of a cameltoe, and have a thong back that leaves her magnificent ass cheeks exposed.
Let’s find out what else makes her ass jiggle…
I soon reach the conclusion that those panties look even better around her thighs as I bend her forward over the couch and slot my tongue inside her creamy cunt. She’s so wet I don’t waste any more time with teasing, sucking up her sweetness, licking and rubbing until any hint of nervous inhibition has dissolved under my oral onslaught and she’s moaning and mashing her soaking pussy against my face. I adore feeling a girl shake apart as I eat her out, and I have a feeling I can guess what will push her over the edge.
I pull her panties right down so she can step out of them, then spread her legs — and her cheeks — wider. I was right, she goes wild as I paint her wetness up her ass crack with my tongue, lapping at the tight pucker until I feel her entire body shivering. I press deeper, opening her up little by little. Her legs are quivering, her booty quaking delightfully against my face, and as the tip of my tongue breaches that tight ring of muscle she has one of the fiercest assgasms I’ve ever given a girl, without any significant penetration.
Her legs are too wobbly to support her after that, so I lie back and pull her onto my face, sucking on her clit as I thrust a finger all the way into her ass. It feels almost impossibly tight at first, but a string of mini orgasms courtesy of my lashing tongue makes her loosen up, and then the way she squirms and squeals as I finger-fuck her ass lets me know I’m hitting the spot. But she really goes crazy when I turn her around so she’s sitting her ass on my face in a squat position and grind my knuckles over her clit as I lick her asshole as hard and deep as I can. I’m lucky she doesn’t suffocate me as she sags down on top of me, her body jerking convulsively… although it wouldn’t be a bad way to go, surrounded by twitching girl-flesh.
As first dates go, that was pretty intense. She’s too dazed (and, I suspect, inexperienced in the ways of lady lovin’) to get me off very effectively with her tongue and fingers, so I’m still horny as I go home and make what under the circumstances I can only describe as a “booty call” to my fuck buddy Tony.
I’m stripped down to my G-string, looking at my ass in the full-length mirror in my bedroom, as he answers the phone.
“Tony, does my ass jiggle?” I ask him, in lieu of saying hello. I bounce up and down a bit on the bed, watching for the ripple effect.
“No,” he replies, “your ass is a firm little peach, baby.”
“Not even when I go on the elliptical trainer at the gym?” I ask, vaguely disappointed.
“No. By the way, you know I’m at work, right? Can we not discuss your sexy ass and all the things I’d like to do to it right now, please.”
“Not even when you bend me over and fuck me from behind?”
“No, but it jiggles when I spank it, and you’d better believe you’re going to get a good hard spanking later!” he growls, hanging up.
So now I have my second challenge of the day: can I wait until Tony gets here to spank me until my cheeks are glowing and then fuck me hard enough to make them ripple like jello?
Or…Part ten: Turned on by a sexy plan
When I finished telling Angela’s story I knew I had to go to work, so I swung my legs around my makeup stool to enjoy the sensation of his erection between my breasts for a moment.
‘Does Sue know about you and Angela?’ he asked.
‘Oh yes. I don’t keep anything from her.’ I adjusted my bra so it was more comfortable.
‘Isn’t she jealous?’
‘No… and how could she be, given she is married to Ted?’
The humour was unintentional, but Liam nearly choked all the same. ‘Wait till I tell Toby that!’
‘What about Toby?’
‘You got a problem with me telling him? He is the only person other than Sue — and you — that has never run out on me. I always tell him everything, anyway, he is the only member of my family I have left.’
On day one, Sue and I had agreed that my house would be the one place where Toby could be himself, so I knew him pretty well. ‘No, of course not… anyway, he is such a nice guy.’
Liam looked unsure for a second. ‘Have you ever let him wear your clothes?’
I checked my mascara. There was no point being anything but honest. ‘Yes I have.’ I watched him in the mirror, because I had absolutely no idea what his reaction was going to be.
‘Sue usually lets him do it the moment Ted leaves for work. It felt kinda weird at first, but hey it’s no big deal, apart from when Ted comes home unexpectedly. Man, have we had some narrow escapes.’ He thought for a moment. ‘So, if you let him dress in your clothes, have you ever had… had…’
‘Had sex with him? No. Remember, he is only just eighteen.’ I gave him a stern look. ‘And before you ask, I don’t think Sue has, either.’
‘Just curious. I never know with Sue or you. If either of you did, it would be good for him. He once told me he couldn’t imagine any woman would ever want to have sex with him. Poor guy.’
Liam sounded so completely matter of fact about his brother’s cross dressing and the whole thing seemed so problematic that I let it drop. ‘Hey, I have an idea. Grab your clothes, I want you to come into work and meet someone.’
By the time I pulled the 911 up in my parking space, Liam had done everything except read the manual and take the vehicle to pieces to see how it worked. When we got out, he announced, ‘It’s awesome, but it’s not exactly the kind of car…’ his voice trailed away.
‘…that you expect a woman to own?’ I replied, my eyes glinting.
He recovered himself. ‘Sue says you only got the first one you bought because it was more powerful than Ted’s.’
That was true. I threw a smile over my shoulder. ‘Still remember his little darling face the first time he laid eyes on it.’
‘Why don’t you like him?’
‘Why does everybody not like him? If he wasn’t so certain that he was right and everyone else was wrong, he would be a damn sight easier to get along with.’ I had lost track of how much unsolicited advice Ted had given me over the years — printed out, it would have filled many boring volumes to bursting point.
‘Who am I going to meet?’
I pressed my key fob on the car park exit door. ‘Patience. You will find out soon enough.’
As we rode the elevator I adjusted his shirt. ‘You look great. I would fuck you right here if it wasn’t for the glass walls.’
Liam was still laughing when we reached my office. I threw my bag on a chair and spread my arms. ‘Make yourself at home. Want a coffee?’ When he nodded, I pressed a button on the intercom. ‘Two coffees, one for me and another black with sugar.’
I sank into my chair. This was going to be hugely entertaining, and I could only speculate at the outcome. But outcome there would be — I knew my PA inside out.
When Angela appeared with the coffee, she looked even more cheekily innocent than she normally did, assuming such a thing was possible. She gave Liam a dazzlingly shy smile of greeting, set down our coffees, and then walked very slowly around his chair, enjoying his puzzled appreciation. Men never seem to know how to respond to her, and he was no different — despite wearing a dress that was sensationally short, she managed to radiate her usual air of tomboyish virginity and I could tell he couldn’t cope with it at all. When she was standing right behind him, her coral lips formed the word, ‘Liam?’ and when I returned an imperceptible nod, she mimed sending a text. Then she was gone, leaving a waft of perfume to linger with her memory.
Liam was wide-eyed. ‘Who was that?’ he asked, jumping to his feet as soon as the door closed. He kept staring as if willpower alone could bring her back.
I studied my nails. ‘My PA. Now, drink your coffee, and be a love, I have some work to do.’
My phone went crazy with incoming texts, so many that in the end I excused myself and walked over to Angela’s office.
Her eyes were wide. ‘Is that really Liam?’
I sat on the edge of her desk. ‘Yep.’
She came up very close, spreading my legs so that she could stand between them. ‘I want to see you having sex with him.’
This was the Angela who had me in her palm. ‘You can’t,’ I whispered. ‘You just can’t!’
Her hand slipped inside my knickers and her fingertip went unerringly for its target. ‘You don’t understand. I really really want to see you have sex with him,’ she breathed, slipping two fingers inside as my pussy went to mush.
‘It isn’t possible,’ I hissed. ‘The situation is complicated enough as it is. Besides, you don’t even like having sex with men!’ On the last point I was confident, because in the time she had been with me I had established that Angela was almost exclusively lesbian in her tastes.
Angela didn’t let her eyes drop for a second as she began to work my clit with the ball of her thumb. ‘I don’t want to have sex with him,’ she replied, withdrawing her hand the precise moment before I would have come. ‘But I want to see you do it, and if you show me, then I will do anything you want me to do.’ This despite wearing an expression as if had she had just walked out of teaching Sunday school.
‘Do you want to be in the room with us, or what?’ Her finger was back at work, rubbing my clit through my panties now, and as the two layers of material slid against each other, the feeling began to build until I could hardly think straight. I was gripping the desk and had to force the words out.
‘All I want is to see him in here, filling you, while you squirm and sweat with lust. I know you won’t fail me. I want to see him sink into you until your pussy can take no more of him and then I want you to look at me when he comes.’ She increased her speed until I gasped and came, mostly for thinking of the scene she had just conjured up. Then I knelt while she stood over me and let me service her dripping slit. Her orgasms were quiet, controlled and ladylike, and as soon as they were done, she slipped two fingers deep inside before releasing her knickers. She held them out so I could them clean. ‘Another coffee?’ she asked, with a brilliant smile, for all the world as if she was seeking approval after finishing typing her first business letter.
In the end it turned out to be easier than I could possibly have hoped. After a brief struggle with my conscience, I rationalised that we used video in training all the time at work, so why not for teaching Liam about sex? When we got back home, I changed into a plunge bra and a dress I hadn’t worn in ages and worked the conversation around to the idea.
‘Like we do our own home porno flick?’ He sounded genuinely entertained by the idea. ‘If we do, I promise there won’t be any fast forward stuff.’
I took my courage in my hands and told him I wanted to film it with a proper video camera. To be honest, I could have told him that I wanted to video us having sex on a Swiss roll and he would probably have agreed — now that I had solved his problem he was desperate to make up for lost time.
The practical side of him soon took over. ‘But who is going to film it?’
With as much matter of factness as I could muster, I replied, ‘Angela. She does all our training videos,’ which was true, for I had spent thousands sending her on endless courses on editing and lighting. I just about managed to keep my voice level, because for all her expertise, it wasn’t quite the same as filming a blue movie.
I needn’t have worried. Liam blew out his lips at the thought, and shook his head, as though he couldn’t believe his luck. ‘Is there any chance that she…?’
‘Maybe, but she isn’t really much attracted to men, darling. Besides, I want you to myself for a while.’ I stroked his hair. ‘Angela says we are going to need two or three cameras, to get all the angles, so she will have her work cut out.’
Maybe Sue’s frank accounts of her sexual experiences had paved the way, but to this Liam said no more than, ‘Why not?’ Then, ‘You have already discussed this with her?’
I realised that I had very nearly let the cat out of the bag, so I leaned over, enjoying the thirst in his eyes as he drank in my cleavage. ‘You don’t fancy her more than me, I hope?’ I asked, pressing my upper arms against my boobs to make them pop.
He spluttered, ‘No, certainly not.’
‘But you do fancy her?’
‘Well, yeah, but who wouldn’t? Are you sure she is alright with this?’ He made it sound as if his major worry was that it wouldn’t go ahead. I felt a flood of relief, mixed with the sort of urgent sexual anticipation that only Angela could create in me.
‘Leave me to talk to her, okay? She does whatever I want.’ It was the only white lie of the evening.As they walked in the room he handed her an envelope. They were coming back from dinner at a posh place in the rooftop of one of the tallest buildings in London. She looked radiant in her little black dress and high heels. It was a celebration of sorts, and the night was still young.
He had flown in early in the afternoon and as soon as they had checked into the room they were fucking like bunnies. Going for dinner had been a necessary break to gather energy and fresh air for the encore session they were about to start. She looked in his mischievous eyes and asked:
“What’s in the envelope?”
He explained that he had written a bunch of positions on a set of cards and she could use them to choose the next position in which she wanted to be shagged. He was always having these unorthodox ideas, and now she was curious. She opened it up and found a familiar set of positions written down:
Missionary on the sofa
Monkey in the bathroom sink
Doggy standing by the mirror
Flat on the belly
…
One card caught her attention. She held it in her hand and looked up at his dark chocolatey eyes:
“What is upside down spoons?”
He answered that he would be happy to show her, as a naughty smile flashed across his face. She loved that look in his eyes, and felt her inner works jump with emotion. It made her feel so wanted, and gave her goosebumps. He helped her off with her coat, and then her shoes.
He had actually helped dress her up before dinner. He liked doing that, and she knew it was a strange kink but she liked it. As she had been lying naked in bed he had gathered the clothes she had brought for the occasion. He had gotten her garter belt on first, then her black stockings. He had then wrapped her up in her short black dress, no bra. And had finished by pulling her panties up.
She liked it when he did that to her. It was a special feeling of being cared for, even if it meant that she had to help with the stockings and correct her dress as she was getting her make up done in the bathroom.
As they were walking to the restaurant she felt some of their mixed juices dripping from her. During dinner it was a constant reminder of their hard workout that afternoon.
They started kissing. Soft in the lips. Her hands busy unbuttoning his shirt. His hands pulling up her dress. She was enjoying the feeling of his warm touch on her. And his hurry to get his hands under her clothes to caress her bare skin. He pulled the zipper of her dress down and helped her out of it, as she opened his shirt and got her hands on his chest.
They also liked undressing each other. It felt as if they were unwrapping their presents. She put her hands up to help him get her out of her dress. As he pushed her dress above her boobs, she started caressing him with soft touches of her fingernails.
She fell back onto the bed as he started kissing her right nipple. She loved the way he circled its tip with his tongue, making it wet and slurping on it until it felt as if her whole boob was made out of stone. As he moved to her other breast she could also feel how he was getting rid of his shirt and trousers.
She liked to lie in bed and have him do things to her. She had told him before how she enjoyed giving up control to him. After he got her second nipple wet and hard he started cruising her body with his mouth. Discovering every inch of her, kiss by kiss. As he got to the bottom of her rib cage she felt how he was sucking harder on her. He was marking the path through her using hickeys instead of breadcrumbs.
She was still lying in bed with her hands up and her dress covering her face. In a way as if she were blindfolded, except that she could free herself at any time. She felt him going down past her belly button and proceeding to her panties.
Her panties were wet, as in extra wet. He removed them and started exploring her vulva with his mouth. He found a little concentrate of their juices at her entrance. It almost felt like candy. He got as much as he could on the tip of his tongue and moved up to kiss her. He had to move the dress above her head to place the sweet dessert he had found on her mouth. She giggled when she realized what it was. As he was freeing her from her dress she asked him:
“So what about that upside down spoons you wrote about?”
He winked at her and moved her onto her side, as if he was going to spoon her from behind. Except that he placed his head at her feet and his knees on her back. He was indeed upside down from her. He opened up one of her legs as she reached for his shaft. It only took a few strokes to have him ready to go in. She placed the tip at her entrance and he moved up her hips to place himself in position.
The visuals were fantastic. She was so wet that he slid all the way in at the first push. He was kissing her left leg and holding her by her waist. She liked seeing how his cock was moving in and out of her. He told her with a wicked smile:
“ Remember how I told you I wanted to see how you masturbate? Well, now is the time. Show me how you touch yourself when we are not together and you are missing me!”
He got her hand on top of her clit and she started her little number, with two fingertips going up and down on top of it. He was moving slowly in and out, as she reached to his shaft to get some of their juices on her fingertips. Her fingers continued the dancing routine, except that the intimate atmosphere had now been replaced by the voyeurism of feeling his stare on her.
This felt so extremely hot to him. He could see in her face what she was experiencing. Every now and then she flashed a smile at him and looked in his eyes. She still had her stockings and garter belt on, and the view of her fantastic body from his vantage point was something out of this world. He could see in her expression how she was concentrating on her orgasm.
Her fingers were doing the final strokes and she knew she would be over the edge soon. The slow in and out dance was helping her build up. She opened her mouth to tell him:
“I am about to come…”
And with a few more caresses she arched her back and released the next batch of energy. He parked his cock all the way inside of her and could feel her shaking surrounding him. He was looking at her, as a spectator who has been given access to a very private show. A show built up of their love, of their want of each other, and from the build up of the days that they had not been together.
They agreed that these are the moments worth living for.Don’t speak to me with words
Talk with lips on skin
Scream with fingers on my back
Send your messageWhen it came to anal stuff she was a virgin. He had not pushed for it because it was not a kink that he was particularly looking for. However he knew from experience that there were girls who really, really liked it. So as they were cuddling in bed he brought the topic up. She was curious but since she did not know what to expect she was in no hurry to try it.
He was giving her oral pleasure, his tongue making pirouettes together with her clit, her labia being their dancefloor. She had her legs on his shoulders and was enjoying the slow and steady build up of energy down there. He had one hand by her butt crack, and the fingers of the other one were caressing the outside of her vulva.
He placed his finger at her entrance. She was relaxed and welcoming the visitor. She moved her hips to accommodate a better angle and his finger just slid inside of her. He felt her cushioned inside, which was extremely wet. He moved his index finger all the way in, but it was not enough. His middle finger came to the rescue and both made it as deep as they could get.
His tongue was concentrating on her clit as he looked up at her. She was observing him with a look of pleasure in her eyes. He paused and asked her:
“Do you want me to try through the back door?”
“If you want…” was her answer. After the long loving session her labia were so engorged that he knew she would probably be quite receptive to his finger. He moved his fingers out and placed the tip of the index one at her back entrance. He started playfully drilling in with a circular motion as she started moving her hips to accommodate this new sensation.
After a few strokes the finger made it all the way inside. He kept stroking as her moaning increased. He was focusing on her clit again and could feel that her emotions were about to overflow. His whole mouth was covering her pearl and he was sucking firmly. Suddenly the walls of her thighs came tumbling down with a roar.
He had brought some avocado oil-based organic lube for them to experiment with. She was now riding him on top. They had melted together again and did not know where one ended and the other started. During one of her motions away, his shaft came out of her. She flashed a mischievous look at him and grabbed his manhood with her hand, while the other one reached for the lube.
She got enough liquid on him and started stroking his cock. It was thick, but she really wanted to try to fit him inside through the back door. She guided the tip in place and started pushing down. It was a new feeling. His finger had just slid inside without much effort, but this thing was major work.
She placed her hands on his pelvis and closed her eyes as she started pushing down in little steps. Her nerves down there were in overdrive as she could feel a bit of a pang with every push. Slowly she made way for him; the deeper it got, the easier it became.
He was looking at her beautiful figure on top of him. Her face framed by her beautiful hair. Her breasts like two flowers in full bloom. His hands on her hips, trying to provide her with some support. She opened her eyes to look at him, and he could feel her internal emotion in her expression.
She moved down to place a kiss on his mouth, and told him:
“Here you go, my anal virginity, a present for you!”When your demure, beautiful wife suddenly proposes an orgy, do you:
a. ask further questions such as why? where? when? eh?
b. blurt out yes and fuck any negative consequences along with other people?
c. become instantly suspicious that this is a psychological mind game and refuse on the sacred grounds of monogamy?
d. suggest attempting reverse wheelbarrow first, or a quickie in a restaurant before the main course?
e. slowly back away from the alien in front of you?
Answer: none of the above. I laughed and said, ‘you’re taking the piss.’ But no piss was being taken. My wife had stolen the eyes of a nympho in heat. She’d even done research and produced colour coded post-it notes (ground rules, pros and cons etc) on sheets of A4.
‘Ah want to do something crazy,’ she said. ‘Don’t you?’
‘How dae you know about an orgy?’
‘A mate of mines was telling me she goes to one her mate arranges. They’re in right now.’
‘What mate is this?’
‘You don’t know her. Ah met her at the gym.’ Question overload. Do you… fuck it.
‘Why not?’ This was me trying not to play it cool like I had a fluffer and an extremely glamorous monthly STD check. ‘If it’s something you want to try, let’s do it. Are you alright with me, you know, doing things with other women?’
‘Are you alright with me doing things with women?’
‘Aye. Ah think ah can live with that.’
‘What about guys?’
‘Ah don’t think am ready to fuck a guy; orgy or no orgy.’
‘Ah meant me.’ Just make out you’re fine with it. Think of the greater good.
We arrive at the orgy headquarters in a leafy suburb far removed from our flat. My wife’s friend of a friend is obviously in the highest council tax band. The lucky bastard. I already fear this will be a scene from the class struggle as I treat this house like a hotel and steal bathroom supplies I might not need.
The place is massive inside and everyone is a bit too friendly, but the drinks are flowing. I suppose that’s vital given the purpose of the visit. The wine makes me feel more comfortable or less panic-stricken as I watch people slowly disappear upstairs past strange erotic art that must be taken down when the family comes to visit. My wife’s doppelgänger asks me if I like the look of certain women. This has to be some sort of elaborate ploy to question my commitment to her. I am unenthusiastic and use nice safe words.
The designated fuck spots in the bedrooms upstairs are filling up. I am now half-drunk and full-horny. These feelings are added to pensive, suspicious, scared and oddly melancholic. A couple befriend us with inane getting to know each other questions. It’s all a bit normal and unorgy like — not that I’m an expert when it comes to the etiquette. I respectfully pretend I need to piss and explore upstairs where doors are shamelessly open; I can see flesh writhing on flesh and people ignoring the searing pain in their knees. I have a nice, long look and take it all in.
I return to my wife who is eager to get going before she loses her nerve. Ourselves and a few other unsure orgy virgins are left dotted around the downstairs area. We are now at the stage where upstairs with the tits and cocks at every turn seems much more relaxing.
‘You okay?’ my wife asks.
‘Aye, in the pink.’
‘Let’s go upstairs,’ she says.
My cock is still flaccid, but I cajole it into a semi by looking in a few of the bedrooms. A gym-sculpted naked woman comes to a door and leads my wife in by the hand. They kiss and leave me looking like a sad animal in an unimpressive zoo. My wife finally remembers she came with a husband and pulls me in. There’s a woman being spit-roasted and a couple masturbating like an American general has launched a preemptive strike on Moscow. My cock responds and quickly assumes complete domination of my feeble brain.
The cock is rapidly rubbered up and in the mouth of another woman. My socks are still on and so are my trousers, but I have dispensed with the top half, which is folded neatly in the corner — my wife’s work after I dumped the shirt at my feet. Why didn’t I take the rest of it off when I had the chance? Now it seems disrespectful to take my cock out of this stranger’s mouth. What’s the protocol here? Never mind. Here comes a dick with nothing but glasses on to masturbate way too close to me for comfort. That’s my cue to get the rest of my clothes off. The socks are a bit of a struggle but they come off without me falling on my arse. Result. I come back to resume my blowjob, but the dick has moved in on my territory. Now I really am a spare prick. I get down on my knees behind my wife and lick her wet pussy.
A masturbating woman in the corner is definitely a turn-on. My eyes focus on her to avoid the cock and arse of the dick standing far too near to my wife. She catches me ogling and makes her way over to put her pussy in my face while I fuck my wife. As Thursday nights go, this in the top ten weirdest. Another guy enters the fray and seems enamoured with my wife, but my cock is staying inside her until he fucks off. I am the orgy spoilsport.
After some rearranging of bodies and embarrassed guffaws, I’m subjected to my wife sucking another man’s cock. I grin and bear it with my cock inside a beautiful, dark-skinned woman, who is a bit theatrical and fond of a verbal barrage. Her demands for me to go harder and deeper draw a few looks from the rest of the shaggers around the room. Eventually I have to get out of her to fly under the radar and not prematurely cum.
I continue wading through a raging sea of pointless, amazing pussy and trying not to cum. Inevitably, I cannot think about enough disgusting stuff to stop myself; it simply has to done. Realising you’ve attracted an audience to watch you cum is a bit disconcerting once the insane wears off. If you’re like me, your sexual hang ups may suddenly bulldoze through paper thin walls like a puritanical Kool-Aid Man.
I am in a rush to leave and not make eye contact with those still participating, especially the ones who want you to linger and salivate like a subjugated dog in front of a demented psychiatrist. No thank you. No more dinner for me. I am full. My fuck-crazy doppelgänger sticks around for another ten minutes, while I think about how to get my real wife back from the black lodge until I’m hard again. Her only disappointment is the absence of cuddling. There’s no cuddling after an orgy; at least not at this one. We will make up for the lack of that once we get home. Kung Fu death grip cuddles are coming.Eric and Tessa had been together for two years. It was a long-distance love affair. They treasured the time that they could spend together. They enjoyed the regular day to day things in life but when they got together things tended to go to the extreme. They drank more and they had a lot of sex. One extended weekend they had together, Eric came eleven times. It was amazing they could both walk after that one. Eric had come out of a loveless marriage and Tessa had been on her own for a few years when they met. They found in each other the highly sexual person they had each been hoping to find.
The sex had been fantastic from the start. It had been surprising and exhilarating to find the ideal lover. He had introduced her to anal sex and to her surprise she enjoyed it a lot with him. She had done it before, but not the way he did it. He enjoyed the lead up and playing as much as the actual penetration. Maybe he was a little preoccupied with the ass but it worked for them.
They enjoyed the fact that they could talk about anything; open sexual communication was something they both wanted. They could explore anything, first in words and if they were both comfortable with it, they moved to the physical. They had been talking about having a threesome for months. The problem wasn’t bringing someone else into it, it was the matter of who it would be. Tessa wasn’t interested in other women. She had always said that she really didn’t care who was licking her pussy but she had no real desire to lick pussy herself. So they would have to find the right guy to join them.
There wasn’t anyone in her circle of friends that she would be interested in. She always kept the idea at the back of her mind when she met different people, wondering if they would be suitable. Eric did the same. He tended to meet more people in his line of work than she did. He thought it would be incredibly hot to watch her with another man. He knew how much she loved giving head and she did it so well; watching her give a blowjob would be hot.
Over the months there were people that they discussed. It wasn’t a high priority but it was fun to add the conversation into the mix when they were having sex. They talked about what she would do to the guy. He told her he wanted to see her giving a blowjob while he was fucking her. That played nicely into her fantasy since she really loved cock. She wanted more than one cock but she wasn’t sure double penetration would be her thing. Having a cock driving into her while she had one in her mouth would be fun.
They planned for her to go to his place for a long weekend. He had been getting some work done on his garage and he had become friendly with the contractor. He considered him a possibility and decided to arrange it so that Dan, the contractor, would come by the house while Tessa was there that weekend. Eric had tried to feel out Dan for a reaction to the possibility of a threesome. He wasn’t specific in case it wasn’t something he’d be interested in. Dan had not committed to anything but he didn’t shut Eric down either.
Eric told Tessa about it on the Friday after she had arrived. She was excited. She had given Eric her criteria for a guy and this one seemed to meet it. They would find out the next afternoon if their fantasy would become reality. That night they had incredible sex anticipating and talking about what could happen. The next day, they went about their regular morning routine. Tessa gave Eric a blow job to wake him up and he couldn’t help but want to put his big, hard cock inside her wet pussy. She always got so wet when she gave a blow job. He fucked her gently at first but then he turned her around and got her up on her knees so he could fuck her hard from behind. She loved it like that but because he was so big sometimes it was like he was actually pushing her forward with the intensity of his thrusts. No matter, she took him in and loved it when he filled her with his cum.
Later in the afternoon Dan came by to discuss some details for the finishing touches to the garage. Tessa checked him out and approved. After they finished their business, Eric invited him in for a few beers and they decided to order a pizza. It all seemed very casual and natural. The drinks continued to flow and as they were sitting around the table the conversation started to turn sexual. Tessa asked Dan what he enjoyed in a woman. He was a breast man and loved nipples. If they stood out, they were that much better to him. He loved squeezing them. He would get hard the harder he squeezed them. Well this was sounding very good to Tessa. She had great tits and her nipples were definitely outstanding and very sensitive!
Maybe it was the drinks but after another beer she grew bold and decided to get up from the table and walk over to Dan. They thought she was just going to the kitchen, but she stood beside him and pulled down her shirt and bra to show him her nipple. Eric smiled and although Dan was a little surprised he hardly skipped a beat as he just reached up and squeezed.
“Those are certainly great nipples,” he said as he squeezed her hard.
She let out a little moan. She had already discussed how she got wet instantly when her nipples were squeezed so both Eric and Dan knew what would happen to her. Dan quickly unleashed the other one and he was squeezing both of them. Well they knew Tessa was getting wet but they also knew that Dan would be getting hard. It wasn’t lost on Eric and sure enough his big cock started to rise. Dan pulled Tessa to him and took her breast into his mouth and bit down on the nipple. Ohhhh, that felt good.
Eric was getting really hard watching this initial contact. He wondered where things would go. Dan looked over to Eric to make sure he was okay with what was going on. Eric gave him a nod, it was fine, maybe even better than they could’ve anticipated. Neither Eric nor Tessa had figured out how things would start. This was working well.
Dan reached for Tessa’s crotch and felt the growing heat. That was all he needed to get his erection even harder. He unbuttoned her jeans and undid the zipper and quickly slid a finger into that wet pussy. Heaven. She was so wet already. She wasn’t kidding when she had said there was a direct connection from her nipples to her pussy.
Dan finger fucked her and she held his head hard to her breast, all while he was still biting her nipple. Eric had to unleash his beast. He undid his pants and brought out that beautiful cock and moved back from the table so that he could stroke it as he watched them. Tessa opened her eyes and locked them with Eric’s as she smiled at him. They hadn’t talked about exactly what would happen, they figured it would just happen, and it sure was. Eric smiled back at her, he was enjoying the show knowing that Dan was getting her so wet.
Dan knew what he could do to a woman, he had a trick up his sleeve and wanted to show them both. He pulled her jeans down further and started moving his fingers on her G-spot. That felt good but Tessa wasn’t ready for what happened next. Within two minutes of him starting, Tessa’s pleasure was building in intensity and her knees were getting weak. All of a sudden she was squirting. Dan quickly took her pants down further while still massaging her. He loved seeing a woman squirt and he knew he would get her going quickly.
Tessa had squirted before but it was usually when Eric had her propped up on the bathroom vanity. She always figured it was the position of his cock hitting her just right. She always felt spent in the best way after she squirted. This was the same feeling. After what seemed like a long time, but probably wasn’t, she needed to sit down. Dan had a big smile on his face and Eric was just surprised. He wanted to know how to do that.
“I can’t believe you got me going so quickly! I’ve never squirted standing up.”
“It’s all in the finger play.”
There was a big chair close by and Tessa went over and collapsed into it. What a feeling that had been. She had a big smile on her face. Eric came over to her and kissed her.
“What did you think of that? You enjoyed it?”
“Oh yes, how could I not?” she replied.
“You know what that did to me? It was fun watching, I want to try that on you but first I need to do something with this.” He was stroking his cock.
She smiled and reached out for his cock. It really was a great cock, to look at and to suck and to fuck. She wanted him inside her and she knew he would oblige. She spread her legs for him to get a feel of her. She was wet and he knelt to have a little taste and then stood up, picked her up and turned her around. He took her by the hips and slowly guided his hard cock into her pussy. He loved looking at her ass as he drove his hard shaft into her. After a couple of slow moves, he couldn’t help himself, he started going faster, he knew she loved it. They had a fantastic sex life, they were in sync and their sex drives were at the same level, very high.
Dan was watching from his chair at the table, it was a good view. He watched as Eric’s cock went in and out and enjoyed watching Tessa’s tits sway back and forth, she really did have great tits. He sat and stroked his cock, this was a good show.
Eric was loving the feel of Tessa’s wetness enveloping his cock. She had a nice tight pussy. He slid in and out easily. At one point he looked over at Dan and took a moment to watch him stroking his cock. The sight of Dan stroking his cock while watching them seemed to get his cock even harder. He slowed it down just a little. Dan gave an inquisitive look to Eric and Eric motioned him over. Dan cupped Tessa’s breast and rubbed her shoulder. She let out a purr and rolled her shoulders. The feeling of Dan’s hands on her and Eric’s cock in her was mind-blowing. It was about to get better.
Dan reached down to rub Tessa’s clit as Eric pumped into her. He also gave a feel to Eric’s balls as he moved in and out. It was such an electric sexual atmosphere, everything felt right. That touch added to Eric’s pleasure.
It wasn’t long before Tessa took Dan’s cock in her mouth and started to really go at him. This was the ultimate. She didn’t really want double penetration, but she sure wanted cock! She was very much in the moment, having cocks coming at her from two directions was fantastic. She devoured Dan’s cock. Eric’s excitement was building, watching Tessa so enthusiastically suck cock was really turning him on and making him so hard.
Dan was loving it. Watching Tessa suck his cock, watching Eric fuck her, it was a great show! They were all enjoying the moment, it just kept going and they were all being satisfied, what more could they ask for?
The visuals were getting the best of Eric, he could feel his orgasm building and building. Tessa sucking cock, the way her back arched and the way she was giving her ass to him. He grabbed her hips tighter and with his signature double pump and then a slight break in the action, he emptied himself into her and let out a wonderfully expressive groan and kept tight inside her.
Tessa broke away from Dan’s cock and enjoyed the sensation of Eric filling her, giving her all she wanted. Dan took a step back and leaned on the chair. He certainly hadn’t realized what was going to transpire when he had come by that afternoon. He couldn’t have been happier with the change of plans for the night.
Tessa moved over to the couch to spread out and relax. Eric came over to sit beside her while Dan went to the kitchen to get more beer, they could all use the refreshments. He sat down on the loveseat and smiled at all the visions that were going through his mind. He knew this wasn’t the end, it was only the beginning.
Soon the conversation turned back to squirting and Dan’s technique. Eric was really interested in how he managed to get a woman to go so quickly. Dan was showing him, he needed to move his fingers like he was motioning for someone to come over but do that with his middle finger as the main motion and his index following. Eric wanted to try it out.
“What do you think, baby, are you ready to go again?”
“I’m not sure, but I wouldn’t want to interfere with your education,” she said with a smile.
She stayed in place, laying on the couch, and spread her legs for them. Somehow this didn’t feel strange. She had only met Dan a couple of hours before but here she was, being his canvas and letting him play with her body. He couldn’t help but reach out for her nipples. They were like bullets and he couldn’t resist them. It didn’t hurt that the reaction of her pussy was almost simultaneous, getting those juices flowing. Eric put his fingers inside her but she wanted more than to just give them what they wanted. She asked that he put his tongue inside her and play with her clit. Eric did as requested and Dan looked on with a big smile on his face and his fingers still pinching her nipples. Now this was something new for her, having her man licking her pussy but having Dan there watching. Yes, she liked it and she locked eyes with Dan, giving him a wicked smile that got his cock hard.
She reached out and grabbed the waistband of his jeans and pulled him closer and started undoing his pants. She wanted cock. Eric was expertly playing with her pussy, she wanted a cock in her mouth. Dan happily obliged. He was already hard as she wrestled his cock out of his pants but as soon as she started playing with him he got bigger in her mouth. He wasn’t as big as Eric but he was still a good size. She took him all in and then started playing with his head. She knew many men liked when she rubbed her tongue at the base of the head on the ridge where the shaft met the head. She was getting him going, there was no doubt about that and Eric raised his head and smiled at her. He knew she enjoyed cock. She was full of sensation, Eric’s expert tongue on her clit and licking her pussy, Dan pinching her nipples and his cock in her mouth. She devoured the cock just as Eric was devouring her pussy. Dan put his head back and enjoyed it all.
With all this going on it didn’t take long for her orgasm to build and Eric knew it was coming. He slipped his fingers into her and got a good pace going. Soon she was holding his head to her pussy while she ground her hips into his face and with her other hand she held onto Dan’s cock. It was building and building and then with one last suck on her clit Eric took her over the edge and she released Dan’s cock and threw her head back and screamed. That was intense!
She had played with two men before but it hadn’t been like this. This time it was all about her. They wanted to please her, her orgasm was the goal and she got it. She lay back and smiled and curled up. Eric licked his fingers and wiped his face. He didn’t notice Dan watching him. Dan wanted some of that but realized it wasn’t the time yet. He hoped he’d have his turn tasting that pussy.
Eric got up to have a smoke on the deck. Tessa was still naked, curled up on the couch, practically purring like a kitten. Dan sat down next to her and started caressing her ass. She had a great body and the way she had reacted to them was thrilling. He kept rubbing her ass and then he couldn’t help himself, he slid two fingers into her. But he didn’t want to make her cum, he just wanted to touch her, to feel her wetness. He really wanted to taste her. He was slow and soft. She enjoyed it and so did he. He took his fingers out and she turned her head just as he put them into his mouth. She smiled. He slid them back in and was gentle. He just wanted to feel her and massage her. She didn’t mind at all, it felt quite nice to have that compared to the rush of the orgasm.
She was still so wet and he wanted to taste her but he knew she wasn’t quite ready for another orgasm. Her pussy had already had a lot of action and it was pretty intense. Eric came back and was a little surprised to see Dan with his fingers inside Tessa. He didn’t really think he could say much considering a few minutes before he had been watching her suck Dan’s cock. It just seemed like an intimate moment and he wasn’t sure how he felt about that.
Eric sat down in the side chair and watched as Dan continued to stroke and caress Tessa’s pussy. Soon he found himself getting hard again and he started rubbing his cock. Tessa had her eyes closed, she was just enjoying the sensations but then she opened them and noticed Eric getting his cock hard again.
“Don’t even think about it, I need a little break and this feels nice.”
“I’m just enjoying the visual,” he said as he continued to rub his cock through his jeans.
Dan was enjoying the dynamic. He could tell Tessa was relishing it all but he picked up on Eric’s hesitancy; he didn’t care. He figured he’d been invited into this play so he was going to enjoy himself too. Dan spread Tessa lips with one hand and with his other hand he slid a finger in. Again, he wasn’t going fast, just slow and steady, but she started moving her hips with his rhythm. She was getting into it. Eric pulled out his cock and started stroking it. A bit of pre-cum came out and he took it with his finger and tasted it.
Tessa was watching him. “Hey, that’s not fair. You should be sharing with me.” She always had a hard time resisting his cock when she saw it. Eric knew this. Dan continued to stroke her but smiled. Tessa reached out her hand toward Eric, wanting that cock. Eric got up and continued stroking his cock. He took the few steps toward her but he didn’t give her his cock right away. He stood just out of her reach and increased the speed of his stroke. Dan noticed that she started to get wetter so he increased his speed just a little bit. What he really wanted was to throw her onto her back and sink his face into her wet cunt but it wasn’t the time for that. She’d just had that. He figured he was using extra special restraint but she had such a pliable body and was so open to experiencing sensations that he was truly enjoying the sensation of his fingers inside her, what the whole experience was giving to her.
Eric continued his strokes for a few more seconds but he didn’t want to deny Tessa what she wanted, and he loved the feel of his cock in her mouth. He stepped to her and she opened her mouth for him. He went in as far as she could take. He kept a similar pace as Dan was doing with her pussy, slow and easy and very enjoyable. The point of playing wasn’t always to climax, sometimes it was great to feel the sensations and enjoy it for what it was. The whole night was the experience. To have a night filled with sexual experiences, a sexual feel to everything that happened. Sex was on the agenda and they wanted it, but sex can take on many forms.
She loved the feel of Eric’s cock in her mouth. He was bigger than most and she had a gag reflex so there was no way that she could take all of him in but that was ok, he never complained, how could he when the way she played with him gave him such pleasure. She was a master of the blowjob. The way she played with her tongue, how she changed pace and position, but it was her enjoyment and desire to give that was the best part of the blowjob. Sure, any guy likes getting a blowjob but when a woman gives with such enthusiasm, it’s not a job.
Tessa always made sure that she was in the moment and she got hot and very wet when she gave a blowjob. Knowing that what she was giving was making her man feel so good, that made her happy and want to give more. That’s why it was so good when she got feedback from her man. Moans and groans, motions, participation went a long way for her. Right now she had the attention of both men and she couldn’t be happier. It was all slow and easy and relaxed and full of sensation.
After a while, Eric pulled out and went out for another smoke. Dan licked his fingers and just relaxed. Tessa laid there and melted into the couch. She was enjoying the total relaxation that sexual satisfaction can bring. They turned the music up and just hung out for a bit.
Eric came back and they sat around just talking about regular stuff. If anyone walked in they would think there were just a group of friends hanging out for the night. But that wasn’t going to last. This was just an intermission.
Eric asked if anyone else wanted a beer and got up to go to the kitchen. Tessa followed Eric, she wanted to make sure he was ok with everything that was going on. He reached into the fridge and as he turned around she was there. She kissed him deeply and he responded. He had no problem with what had been going on. It wasn’t the norm, but he was enjoying it and he knew she was too, that was very important. He took her in his arms and really kissed her.
They held the embrace and enjoyed the moment.
Dan was wondering why his beer was taking so long so he came into the kitchen to get it himself. He saw Eric and Tessa together and took a quick step back but stopped and watched. Neither of them had heard him come around the corner but it was interesting to watch them kiss. They devoured each other in a very intimate way. That was just between them.
“What’s a guy gotta do to get a beer around here?”
They slowly parted. Dan wasn’t an interruption for Tessa, he was an addition. She looked from Eric to Dan and then down to their pants. She took hold of their waistbands and pulled them both towards her. She knelt and smiled up at them as she started undoing buttons. They helped getting themselves free and ready for her. She took one look up at them and then she looked at both cocks in front of her and dove in. Two really good cocks ready for her, a very good thing.
She took Eric first and got him wet and then did the same to Dan. She worked them both, she hoped she could get one to cum and the other would follow, she’d take as much as she could. She had never given two blowjobs at once. She’d watched porn of course but it was a little different to have both presented to her. They both started to grow harder, they were enjoying this and so was she. Tessa went a little faster, she switched between them, she always had her hands on them. She was trying to pump Dan while she went down and sucked on Eric’s balls, she knew how he enjoyed when she mixed things up. He threw back his head and let out a low, loud moan. Dan seemed to get harder with that.
Well she couldn’t leave Dan out of the mix, she went back to him and took his balls in her mouth. Yes, Dan understood why Eric moaned. This was feeling fantastic and knowing that she was excited and enthused to have both, it made it so much better. She kept going on them, switching up, and then at one point she took both hard cocks into her mouth. She was surprised she could get her mouth wide enough but wow, what a feeling to get them both.
Cock, all cock. She was excited and very much in the moment. She felt in control. Sure, they were the ones with the hard cocks but she was orchestrating it and controlling it. That was a heady feeling. She went with it and made sure they were enjoying the sensations. She knew she was. This night had been more than she could’ve imagined.
She noticed that Eric was grinding just a little bit faster. Her moans grew louder as she felt him responding to her. She knew it added to the experience for Eric to have Dan there, to be standing next to each other, two hard cocks. Guys were usually competitive but this wasn’t like that, they were all enjoying the pure, raw sexuality that had taken over for them all.
She wanted to take him down but she didn’t want to leave Dan out. This was her chance to have both men cumming on her tits, she’d take what she could in her mouth but she wanted them all over her tits too. After all it wasn’t all about them, she was going to get what she wanted. Rubbing warm cum all over her chest was so decadent to her, she loved the feeling.
Tessa had Eric in her mouth and pumping Dan hard with her hand. Who would be the first to cum? She was pretty sure they were both getting close. She switched over to Dan for a moment and Eric took his own cock in his hand. She kept her eye on Eric so she would know when to open for him. It didn’t take long, he started to moan and since Dan wasn’t cumming yet, she came off him and opened her mouth wide for Eric to shoot right into her.
The sight of Eric cumming and Tessa’s hand on his cock was all it took for Dan to follow suit. He took his cock back and gave the last few pumps as he watched Eric’s white cum shoot right into Tessa’s mouth. He aimed for her chest but Tessa saw what was happening and quickly turned to capture some of him in her mouth as well. Eric continued to cum on her chest. When her mouth was full she lifted her chin and Dan finished off on her chest.
She looked up at them and opened her mouth to show them both and sure enough some cum came out to trickle down her chin. She smiled and drank them down as she started to smear them together across her tits. The warmth of them made her nipples hard. It couldn’t have turned out better.
She licked the last drop from her lip and sat back on her heels. Oh yes, this was a fucking memorable night. The feel of their hands on and in her body, her breasts, her skin and her clit, to be finished off by their hot cum spread over her. A night that would not be forgotten.She had been out with Julia, her assistant, at Chin Chin on Sunset to celebrate a new account for her dance consulting company. As they were eating, they couldn’t help noticing a group of professional athletes out for a night out at a table nearby. Christina didn’t know anything about sports teams, so she probably had no idea it was some famous faces from the sports world sitting there eating fancy Chinese food. But she noticed them.
Andre (obviously I’ve changed all their names!) the good looking football player seated there serving himself up barbecue pork, didn’t play for a Los Angeles team. He played for a team back east, but like many professional athletes he came to LA for various professional and social activities, shooting commercials, meeting with agents, and so on. At the table with him was a pro baseball player named LaShawn, and a basketball player named Lester. At one point Andre made eye contact across the way with Christina. She has a fleck of purple in her irises, and sometimes it catches the light in a peculiar way that makes a violet colored spark across the room. That’s probably what Andre saw. She smiled at him, and he smiled back. That was the end of it.
But later when she excused herself to go to the bathroom, Andre’s baseball player friend, LaShawn, came over to Julia and told her, “Pardon the intrusion, but my friend over there, Andre, he noticed your friend and he was wondering if you could give her his number.” He handed Julia a card with Andre’s number on it.
“She’s married,” said Julia, without missing a beat, and handed him back the card. “But thank you anyhow.”
The baseball player bowed politely and excused himself, taking the card back to his friend and no doubt razzing him a bit about striking out like that. When Christina came back from the bathroom, Julia told her what had happened and they shared a laugh. Julia, of course, knew nothing about my wife’s hobby, and found the whole thing amusing but not surprising, as people had come up to her many, many times before to ask about Christina.
On their way out, Julia didn’t see my wife very casually and sneakily pass by the professional athletes’ table and drop her card in front of Andre. He looked up at her in great surprise. She winked and carried on to catch up to Julia.
Andre called and texted Christina a bunch of times that week, but she was very busy and couldn’t arrange a time to meet him. She wasn’t even sure she wanted to meet him. Finally, she came to me and told me this football player was texting her.
I am not a big sports guy. I don’t know anything about pro sports, but I had at least heard this guy’s name. And it was kind of intimidating. I felt something very hard in my chest. A famous guy was texting my Christina. This was a new feeling.
“Wow,” I said. “He’s pretty famous I think.”
Needless to say, that was a night of googling. I boned up on Andre and learned all about his career and his rushing statistics and all kinds of stuff. He was a super successful athlete.
“He’s also married,” I told her.
“Yeah,” she said. “So am I.”
“I wonder what he was doing running around LA handing out his business card to chicks like you.”
“Yeah, I wonder,” she said. “Maybe he likes older women.”
My wife pretends to be in her late thirties. Who knows how old any woman is? She keeps in great shape. You would never know she has teenaged kids. She looks maybe in her early thirties. But still, that is a bit of a stretch for a professional football player in his twenties. He was definitely age inappropriate for her. Weren’t there enough 22-year-old cheerleaders for him to bang? Why did he have to pick on my wife?
“What’s wrong?” my wife asked the next morning during breakfast. “You look sick.”
“I am sick,” I complained. “I am worried sick about this football player. He’s…he’s…too much.”
“Too much what,” she said.
“He’s too famous. He’s too good looking. He’s too in shape. He’s too fucking perfect.”
“OK honey,” she said sweetly. “If you want, I’ll block his number. You know we haven’t even spoken. He just sent me a few texts. I’ll cut it off. No problem.”
I felt better then. But right away I had seller’s remorse.
What if this guy really was the fuck of the century and I was depriving my lovely Christina of it?
That day at work I locked myself in the men’s room stall and I couldn’t help beating off to the thought of this football player doing my wife. I wouldn’t be able to watch, no way. A famous guy like that does not want to be watched having sex. I wouldn’t even be allowed to wait downstairs in his hotel. I would have to wait outside, in the car. While they went upstairs. He was probably saying in the Peninsula or one of those other super nice Beverly Hills places. I would be circling the block, there’s never parking on Rodeo. Christina would be upstairs with this running back. He would be running his hands down her naked back. He would turn her over and run his big fingers down her shoulders, and onto her breasts. He would be stroking her nipples. He would be getting an erection. He would pull his erection out of his briefs. It would be huge. A big black cock.
“Mmmm,” Christina would say. “Yummy.”
Then she would suck it.
And so it went. I was so into it I went through the whole routine about four times that day, my wife being satisfied by the largeness of Andre. By the beautiful body of this star athlete, his rippling muscles, his handsome, devilish smiling face. He would be talking to her as he was running his fingers across her naked body.
“I wanted to tap that the moment I saw you across the room at that Chinese place,” he was saying.
“Why?” she would sigh, fishing like she does, for the praise and adulation.
“You got the prettiest eyes I ever saw. They caught me in their grip. I couldn’t get out of their grip, you know. That’s what I do for a living, I evade tackles. I couldn’t evade the tackle of your eyes.”
“I tackled you,” she sighs.
“You took me to the ground, girl,” he said. “You slammed me. And now look, this black motherfucker is all yours. I’m gonna do anything for you. Anything you want.”
“Will you film a promo for this sports club I’m promoting.”
“Oh hell yes,” he said. “You just send the shit over to my agent. I’ll sign anything. Just let me fuck you baby.”
Now I’m not one of these guys in the cuck community who is obsessed with watching my wife get the BBC, the big black cock. I don’t care what color it is, I just want it to be big. And so does Christina. I am also made slightly uncomfortable by the racial component to a lot of the cuck porn. It seems to be perpetuating the racist stereotype of the African American male as wild sex beast. But that’s not what Andre was. He was a charismatic, well-loved person. And I was so happy, in my fantasy, that he was making my wife so horny. She didn’t know she was the kind of person a famous football star would like to fuck. This must be kind of blowing her mind. As it was blowing mine.
That night at dinner I mentioned to Christina, “Listen, I had a think about it. If you want to call Andre I have no objection.”
“Aww….” said Christina. “Are you sure? I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.”
“I’m sure,” I said. She gave me a big wet kiss.
It was about three days later that they got together. It wasn’t a hotel. Turns out that Andre had a huge mansion in Beverly Hills, one of those things they call a Mega Mansion. But his family didn’t live there. They lived in in the north east. When Andre came out to LA, though, he stayed in this enormous place.
“It was like a castle,” Christina told me, when she got home that night after her date with him. “It was like twenty rooms. And he was all alone there.”
“Did you have fun?” I asked her.
“Sure,” she said. “But…gotta say. He wasn’t that big.”
“Oh no?”
“He was about your size,” she said. “Not small, but…”
“So you didn’t fuck him?”
“What would be the point?”
See, all African American males are not huge. That’s a cuckold community myth. My wife has had two black guys. One was huge. The other was not. Go figure.
“We fooled around a little and then I said goodbye,” she said. “I’m gonna go up and take a shower.”
I found out later that night, after a lot of digging, how it all went down.
She drove over to his house. He had some champagne all set out. She took some sips of the champagne. She asked about his family, his wife and so on. He didn’t want to talk about it. He asked about her family. She told him about me, about my strange proclivities.
“He should be here watching,” he said, when he heard. “Why the hell don’t you call him?”
He was into it!
“No,” said Christina. “I want you all to myself.”
“You got me baby. You got me all to yourself.”
He went in for the kiss and they made out for a long time. Then he took her by the hand over to the master bedroom. It was an enormous oval shaped bed. There were fish tanks and an exotic lighting set up so the room was glowing with red and yellow. And then, she saw smoke. He had some kind of smoke machine.
She laughed.
There was some intense loud music then, just in time as Andre stripped off his clothes and revealed his boner. Nice average sized boner. My wife went over and sucked it. He wanted to cum in her face but she moved her head away and he came onto the fish tank next to the bed.
“Oh man, I came on Snoop’s tank.”
That was what he called his fish. Snoop Dog. Cause it was some kind of Dog Fish, I guess.
“Now lie back girl, he told her. “I want to slide those panties off you and make you as happy as you just made me.”
He slid off her panties and ate her. By the time she came, he was hard again.
“You ready for the real deal?” he asked her. “You ready to fuck Andre?”
“Nah,” said Christine. “I’m good.”
“For real, baby?” he said, hurt. “I can taste you down there, you’re ripe and ready for it.”
“Let’s save something for next time,” she said, with some authority. He got the message.
“Alright, alright,” he said. “That’s cool. At least I don’t have to lie to my wife. I didn’t fuck nobody.”
“Neither did I,” she said, getting her clothes back on.
“But won’t your husband be disappointed?” he said. “Didn’t he want you to fuck me?”
“Whose life is it?” she asked him. “His or mine?”
“Oh baby, you are one powerful female,” he said, admiring the steely strength of my Christina.
After she told me that final detail, in bed that night, she said, “My darling, you know yours is the only average sized cock that I’m ever gonna let into this pussy.”
She pulled me into her, and I fucked her. My wife! So loyal, I almost wanted to cry.
So Andre ended up filming a promo for Christina’s company, just like he promised. Then he texted her almost every time he came out to LA. Finally, his team came to play here. I knew she’d be hearing from him. She was polite, and told him no. He offered us bench seats, box seats, all kinds of shit.
“I want to meet that crazy husband of yours,” he said. “He sounds like a real freak. Tell him I’ll fuck you in front of him.”
“No, Andre,” she said. “We’re too busy. Maybe next time.”
“Come on, I got this game coming up, help me out here,” he begged.
“I am helping you out, Andre,” she said. “You gotta stay hungry!”
“Oh baby, I’m more than hungry. I’m desperate. I’m gonna die.”
Christina is a little cruel, but you knew that. She could easily have made a sharp cut and blocked Andre’s number. But the idea of this superstar athlete drooling for her, it made her so horny.
“You’ll be fine,” she said on the phone. He must have been really whining and pretending he was dying because she wouldn’t let him fuck her. My wife was grinning from ear to ear.
“Bye Andre,” she said.
Then she hung up on him.
She looked over at me and smiled. I knew what she was saying with that smile. “I got his power, all his power, and I got it by not fucking him. Every time it’s different. Sometimes you get their power by fucking them. But sometimes you get it by not fucking them.”
We watched the game that weekend. Andre got the ball and blasted through about six guys to score a touchdown in the last second. Winning the game.
“See,” my wife said to me. “See what you can do when you stay hungry!”
My wife wants me to stay hungry. She wants me to stay crazy for her, to always long for her, to be hungry to improve myself and to one day, maybe, become her bull. I’m not there yet. But the night she dated Andre and I fucked her instead of that famous football player, for one night at least, I felt like quite the stud.2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.1And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.1Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, having Beth–el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;
6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.1And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
7And they returned, and came to En–mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar.
8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.1After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.
9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.1And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba.
16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.I have many secrets; memories of my past, held under lock and key, seldom revealed. My private thoughts overwhelm me. Sometimes I feel I may internally combust if they are not set free. Over time, these thoughts turn into curiosity. Then they become cravings. Finally, the cravings become a need for action.
For me, the craving is just as strong as the need to eat, the need to breathe. This uncontrollable urge has gotten me into some sticky situations, no pun intended. Every once in a while, I have a deep-rooted need to fuck strangers. I don’t mean having blind dates that turn into one-night stands. I have crossed a line in my sexuality that I never imagined I would pass. My latest cum-craving encounter took place in a men’s restroom.
I was having dinner alone at a restaurant just outside the city. That night, I was more horny than hungry. I noticed the place had a handsome selection of hunks that I wouldn’t mind taking home. But I didn’t want to get to know anyone first and go through the stupid interview process. I didn’t even want to talk. I didn’t want to look at their face. I just wanted to fuck.
I snuck into the men’s restroom and undressed in the stall. I sat on the toilet, impatiently tapping my feet and biting my nails. I heard the door open. This beautiful big cock poked through the glory hole. I looked at it in awe. My mouth watered, just thinking about sucking and swallowing it until I choked.
I wrapped my hand around the stiff prick in front of me. It was so big; my fingers couldn’t even reach all the way around when I held it in my hand. I ran my tongue around the head, slowly wetting the tip. I licked under and over, then suctioned my mouth around the head. I took as much of it in my mouth as I could. I relaxed my jaw, held my breath, and bobbed my head back and forth. My throat was opening nicely around the shaft, letting it slide down deeper. It felt so good in my mouth. Each tasty stroke made me think about how it would feel inside my cunt. I was getting soaked just thinking about it.
I got down on my knees, pressing against the wall, hoping to swallow every inch. It was so deep; my lips could reach the duct tape outlining the glory hole. The tip felt like it was sliding through my throat, nearing my collarbone. I held it in, and moaned on it as I let it glide out of my mouth slowly. Long strings of saliva covered the shaft. I spat on it and spread my spit all the way to the base. Then I held my mouth wide open to take it back in. The cock started thrusting in and out, getting harder by the second.
My clit was throbbing. I let the anonymous guy fuck my mouth harder and faster. I could hear him groaning with pleasure. His hands scraped the partition wall as he chased his climax relentlessly. Suddenly, I could taste his cum filling my mouth and flowing down my chin. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and jerked out every drop between my lips, then let it drip down my body. The hot, sticky fluid felt so good on my skin.
I spread the cum over my chest and around my breasts like it was a luxurious lotion. I sucked it off my fingers and spat it out again, trying to soak my entire body in it. I slid my hand between my legs and circled my clit rapidly. My eyes clenched tight. I didn’t stop rubbing my pussy until I was shaking like crazy, coming hard all over my fingers.
I opened my eyes again and saw the cock was still stiff and ready for more. I licked my lips and smiled, eager to fuck it. I placed my foot on the toilet seat and leaned forward, reaching back to guide the hard cock to my cunt, and took it deep inside me from behind. It hit every sensitive spot, making another orgasm rise within me, even stronger than the first.
I rubbed my clit slowly, meeting the rhythm of the cock thrusting inside me. I pressed my ass closer to the wall so I could feel every inch of this beautiful stranger. My entire body stiffened, then quivered as I came powerfully from the inside out. Pussy juice sprayed down my thighs, soaking me in my own secretions.
That sexy groan through the wall was getting louder. I turned around to suck him again, the shaft drenched with my sex. I jerked the base rapidly, wrapped my lips around the engorged head, and whirled my tongue around it from between my teeth. A strong surge of cum flowed between my lips. I reveled in the tangy taste, then let the cock spray hot cum on my face.
The stranger left. I sat on the commode letting my body gradually relax; I was covered in spit, sweat, and cum. When I finally got cleaned up, I had to use my panties as a washcloth.
It was a beautifully filthy experience. To this day, I don’t know how I got the courage to try something that crazy. Somehow, the act fulfilled me. I was relaxed and happy. I felt a high I’ve never reached before. I have kept this dirty secret inside me for a long time. I could never put the words together to explain the details… until now.It has been six months since she first pushed his face into the mud with her boot and still he has not earned the right to be given keys to her apartment. He still has to endure the embarrassment of having the building’s doorman let him into her home.
At one point he had considered asking whether he might have a key but then thought better of it lest he incur her wrath.
Today is no different and, as always, he imagines the doorman smiles to himself with contempt as he walks ahead of him to the door of her apartment. The doorman does not bother to say goodbye before locking the door behind him.
The apartment is immaculately clean and he is almost immediately able to detect the faint scent of her shampoo. Maria will be home in less than an hour so he has no time to lose. He runs though the mental checklist that has become ingrained in his mind and sets about dutifully performing each task; checking the refrigerator to ensure that the milk is still fresh (at least one full day until the use-by date), watering the orchids to her exacting expectations (to soaking, every fifth day), switching on the standing lamps in the lounge and guest bedroom but never her own bedroom, rearranging the magazines on the coffee table (one pile for each title, ordered so that the latest editions are on top). Despite his thirst he does not fetch a glass of water and instead sits down on the sofa. And then, finally, he allows himself to relax. Now there is nothing to do but wonder what she might be wearing today.
It’s past six when he hears her key in the door. The sound jolts him to attention and he quickly gets up from the sofa and smoothes down and rearranges the cushions before turning to face the door. The moment the doorknob turns, his heart leaps in anticipation of her angelic light washing into the room.
When she sees him, standing there perfectly focused on her arrival, she smiles, “Hello, Anthony.”
He returns her greeting in the way that he has been taught to do, “Hello, Maria.” He feels her warm glow subsume his entirety.
She drops her coat and bag on the floor of the foyer and absentmindedly kicks the door closed behind her before looking through her mail and letting each discarded envelope drop to the floor beside her bag. He wants to dash forward and scramble to catch the envelopes in mid-air but dare not. He might later be given the opportunity to pick them up and neatly arrange them on the small table where her bag goes.
“Sit down,” she says, before walking through to the kitchen, leaving him in the lounge, quivering like a dog awaiting its first command.
When she finally returns to the lounge she’s holding a glass of water which she places down on a coaster on the low table (he ensured that it too was in place). Then she sits down next to him.
“Are you thirsty?”
He nods.
“Well just wait a little longer, ok?”
He smiles and nods again.
With a sigh she kicks off her stiletto heels and sinks back into the sofa. He turns to face her.
“We’re going out tonight,” she continues, “to dinner at a bistro with Sarah.”
He keeps four sets of clothing in the guest room closet to meet the needs of any occasion and knows that she will not ask whether he has an appropriate one at the ready.
She puts her hand on his head and pulls at a few of the curly locks that are beginning to creep around his ears. “Do you need a haircut again?”
He answers with a question that is, in fact, a request. “Maybe tomorrow?”
“No. Your father hates it when your hair gets long.”
Without a word she gets up from the sofa and walks through to her bedroom. He listens to her move through the room, opening and closing cupboard doors and then walking through to the bathroom where she turns on the shower. His mind sees her undress, open the door to the shower, get into it and then close the door again.
A few minutes later he hears her call his name and launches himself up from the couch and towards her bathroom.
The shower cubicle’s glass is opaque with steam and she instructs him to open the door. When he does so he finds her naked inside, her hair black with wetness. Her hands are flat on her lower belly, her fingers framing her pussy.
“Clean me.”
Maria never uses soap on her vagina and he knows that this is a great privilege. He reaches for the buttons of his shirt to undress but she stops him, “No. Keep your clothes on.”
His pulse races at her words and he drops to his knees before shuffling into the cubicle; in under the steaming water that covers first his head and then his shirt and pants. His hands move towards her hips and she gives her consent by placing them on her skin exactly where she wants them to be. With water streaming down his face he opens his mouth and places it onto her vulva. As his mouth finds her body she lifts one hand from his and grips the back of his head to pull him into her.
He first licks the water from her skin and then uses his tongue to open the folds of her vulva to expose her clitoris. Through the rushing water he hears her exhale and feels her fingernails dig into his scalp. Eyes closed, his focus is now exclusively on her, not the cling of his drenched shirt or the chafing of his wet pants or the dull ache that is forming in his knees against the edges of the tiles. As he works to lick and rub against every inch of her pussy she starts bucking her hips, pushing herself into his mouth. He tastes the day on her, the familiar, unknowable subtlety of her cruel body as it moves through the day.
He becomes frantic with desire, desperate to give her everything and anything she demands of him. Nothing exists outside of her insistence on his perfect, panting obedience in service of her.
She wants more from him, deeper into her, every last atom of his corpse directed into her wetness. And then, finally — finally — she calls out in orgasm. A flood of relief washes over him as he is filled with the innermost core of her being.
But there is no time to savour the moment as she violently pushes him from her and slams him down onto the wet shower floor. His head thumps against the tiles causing searing pain to reverberate through his skull but he does not cry out. Instead, as she steps over him, leaving him curled up and wet on the floor with water torrenting down on him, he returns to his own body, bathed in contentment.
His day is complete; perfected by her debasement of him.“Stay where you are.”
Michael’s words are not an instruction; they simply confirm what I already know to do. I’m seated on a velvet stool in the corner of the room; a curtain brushes against my back. The blindfold isn’t necessary, I know to keep my eyes closed.
Michael disappears into the room full of people; their movements and laughter put me at ease. That I am naked is natural and reassuring.
The voices whisper onto my skin and the air holds my breasts in place. I can sense people walking past me; their footsteps indent the carpet, folding it in waves that crest and break against my bare feet and up along my legs towards my vagina.
I focus on maintaining my posture; spine straight, chin up, breathe into my tummy.
I’m untroubled by how long I will wait here for Michael’s return; I focus on maintaining my posture.
When Michael touches my face it shocks me out of my reverie. I feel him bend his face towards me, his rough skin grazes my cheek as he breathes into my ear, “Good girl. I have something for you.”
He moves his face away and places his right hand on my cheek. I lean into it and sigh. He brushes my lips with his thumb and then pulls down on my jaw to open my mouth. His thumb slides into my mouth and moves onto my wet tongue which he pushes down; my throat opens in response.
“Just like that,” his voice is strong and calm as he withdraws his thumb. My mouth and throat remain open, ready to receive his next instruction.
I listen for clues of what’s to come but there are none. And then I feel another hand on my face; a different hand, less familiar than Michael’s. The hand holds my face in place as an erect penis slides into my mouth. I close my lips around it, careful to not let my teeth engage with the swollen flesh.
As I suck on the cock, my head swaying and dipping as my lips and tongue work, I search for clues as to whose it might be. There are none other than the clear facts that my oral service is not being rendered unto Michael.
A male voice rises and breathes in unison with the movements of my mouth. Two hands grip the back of my head, unravelling my loosely braided hair. As the hands pull on me the cock becomes more insistent as it works its way towards my throat. I slack my jaw to let it fuck my throat as the male voice grows into waves of sound that surge through my brain.
The voice grows again, to a roar, as semen fills my mouth and I swallow obediently.
It withdraws from my mouth, my tongue folds onto the shaft as it does. I swallow again to clear my mouth of the white stickiness that covers it.
Once I’ve regained my perfect posture Michael’s face bends towards me to allow his mouth to breathe into my ear, “Yes. That was good. Only two more to go.”Prologue
Mark felt a surge of excitement as he boarded the flight. Something told him this trip to the US was going to be special. He had always led a staid and steady life. He had never cheated on his wife or had sex with anyone before marriage. Considering that he lived in a conservative society, it worried him that he would die without having experienced the feel of another vagina gripping his cock.
Rosa suppressed a grimace as her boss requested her to keep a few hours post-work free the following day. An important overseas client needed to be entertained.
“But boss, we have our Gala Charity Soiree tomorrow evening,” she protested petulantly. Actually she was planning a mutual pussy-licking session with her new Latina girlfriend. She wanted to look her best for the event and no facial or make-up could give her the glow that scorching sex did.
“Rosa dear,” her boss cooed, “I’m giving you the afternoon off. You can leave with Mr Spader after lunch. You will be back in time for the soiree.”
Brittany stuffed her sex toys into her classy bag just in time, as her grandma entered her room. “Brittie darling, I hope you remember you have to take me out somewhere nice tomorrow afternoon.” Brittany nodded helplessly. Brittany was just 18, but she was precocious, well-informed and always well-prepared.
The day of the action
Mark sauntered casually into Rosa’s office and walked straight into her boss’s cabin. As he passed by Rosa, she looked up to see this tall, slim guy wearing a spotless white shirt tucked into skintight jeans. She observed that he parked his penis slightly to the right. She was always quick to notice such details. And the new Mr Burberry fragrance he wore further enhanced his persona.
Immediately after their power lunch, the boss brought Mark over to Rosa’s desk and introduced him. Mark was the consummate gentleman as he handed a stylishly wrapped gift to Rosa. He appreciated her from head to toe, resplendent in the little black dress she was wearing ready for the soiree later. Her pictures did not do justice to her statuesque beauty.
“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” exclaimed Rosa.
“It’s just seminal chocolates and a bottle of wine for the beautiful countryside lady,” said Mark with a dismissive gesture.
Rosa had never heard of seminal chocolates. But she decided not dwell on it. She didn’t like sweets, and would probably gift them to the Latina hottie.
As they left the office, Rosa asked Mark if there was some place in the city he was particularly keen on visiting. Mark insisted they check out the planetarium. “It’s supposed to be the best in the world,” he gushed.
Rosa groaned inwardly. In all her years here, she had never had any inclination to visit the planetarium. For all his dapper demeanour, this guy seemed really boring! Suddenly the afternoon loomed large upon her.
Mark was really enthusiastic. He had just booked tickets for a show at the planetarium. The auditorium became pitch dark as the show began. One by one each star in the ceiling lit up and recounted its story.
Rosa gripped Mark’s hand tight, blurting, “Sorry, I never realized it would be so dark in here. I get nervous in the dark.”
Mark reassured her and held her hand protectively. After some time he could sense her relaxing, but still continued to hold her hand and allowed it to rest on her thigh. Her skin felt supple and silky smooth. As his hand stayed on her thigh, he could feel her temperature rising. He sensed this as a cue to move upwards.
Rosa realized that Mark’ hands were doing more than was appropriate. But she liked his touch and the sensations it was unleashing. His fingers crept under her panties and gradually towards her juicy pussy lips. God, she was so wet and so ready!
As Mark’ fingers were working their magic, Rosa unzipped his jeans and yanked down his briefs. His erection was ramrod hard and towering. As his cock jerked free the fresh fragrance of Mr Burberry wafted across the auditorium. Mark liked to splash perfume liberally on his pubes, especially when he anticipated action. Rosa ran her hand along the entire length, marvelling at its architecture. This was a piece of art!
The sudden whiff of cologne stirred Brittany, who was seated beside Mark. For a while she had felt there was something going on in the seat next to hers. Now, as her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she could clearly see a girl stroking her neighbour’s majestic dick. Well, this afternoon with her grandma was turning out to be quite exciting!
Rosa had a feeling that what she was planning to do was quite precarious. But she couldn’t wait to have that cock in her. With Mark’s fingers inside her, she reached for her purse, removed a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic of her sexy G-string. Then she lifted up and shifted onto Mark’s seat, in one smooth motion mounting her wet pussy onto his rigid cock. It filled her so completely! She savoured the sensation for some time. She began to move up and down slowly and measuredly. The right sided slant of Mark’s cock was allowing it to just graze past her G-spot, creating waves of pleasure.
As the tempo on her left was rising, Brittany decided to join the action. She ran her hands all over Mark and Rosa, and finally settled for Rosa’s anal opening, just teasing and tantalizing it. Rosa quivered with excitement.
Mark realized that the hands stroking his balls and teasing his nipples did not belong to Rosa. He decided to go with the flow and unzipped Brittany’s jeans to find out she was not wearing panties. Her pubic mound was soft, supple and bald. Her pussy lips were swollen and succulent. She looked so youthful, but her actions told him she was not a virgin. He tentatively parted her lips and inserted his index finger. He marvelled at the feel of the soft, smooth flesh.
Brittany raised the game to another level. She extracted a butt plug from her purse, coated it with lube and shoved it up Rosa’s ass. Rosa was now almost convulsing with pleasure. Brittany tugged at the string, extracting the butt plug with a jerk. This triggered off a series of orgasms that racked Rosa’s body. Her vaginal muscles contracted wildly, clasping Mark’s cock like a vice. Mark started spurting in copious bursts to the wildest climax in his life.
His finger flicked upward to Brittany’s button-like clit, reverberating against it insistently. Brittany came for the first time in her life, stars swirling around her eyes. Simultaneously a meteor shot across the planetarium with a roar, drowning out the involuntary guttural sounds of the sexual offenders.
The threesome quickly adjusted their clothes as the show came to an end. No words were exchanged, only knowing smiles as they left the auditorium.
Epilogue
Rosa went commando to the party and was in her element. Everyone asked her what she had been doing, as she looked so hot and stunning.
Brittany instantly dumped her cocky boyfriend who did nothing all day but admire himself and his royal member in the mirror. She was surprised that his humongous cock could not do to her what a finger did.
Her grandma could not stop praising the show at the planetarium. “It was so realistic! You know, at the end when the meteor fell, I actually felt my seat shake!” Brittany just smiled.
The next day Mark rang Rosa to thank her. Rosa thanked him for the wine and chocolates. “I don’t really eat sweets but my friend who had them was raving about them. She wanted to know where she could buy some.”
Mark tried to steer the conversation to something else. But Rosa was insistent. The Latina chick had genuinely loved the chocolates, particularly the sweet coating.
“Is she as hot as you?” teased Mark.
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“I can demonstrate the manufacturing process. I did a weird thing. I bought some chocolates. I then jacked off thinking about you. Four prize chocolates were coated with my semen, repacked and gift wrapped before being handed to you. Remember I told you seminal chocolates?” he said sheepishly.
Rosa gasped audibly .
“No offence, dear,” reassured Mark in his most disarming tone. “I know it was gross. Please forgive me, it was just a crime of passion!”After Beth caught me wearing her lingerie and then turned me into her sex slave under threat of outing me to my wife, friends and colleagues, working with her in the office was very different.
For one, I was now forced to wear her panties to work. She’d told me that every time she looked at me, she wanted to know I was wearing something intimate of hers.
At first I hated the thought. But that changed the first morning I slipped on a gorgeous white thong she’d sent me. There was something so thrilling about having her lingerie cupping my cock. I was hard every time I got dressed.
Getting dressed had become a little complicated, though. Making sure my wife never saw me slipping on a thong was not easy. A few times I’d had to take the panties to work and put them on in the restroom when I arrived.
Making eye contact with Beth was truly awkward. Every time our eyes connected, she smirked at me. Not in a cruel way, but definitely in a you’re mine way. It was strangely intoxicating. Knowing that I had to do whatever she asked was proving to be a huge turn on.
I felt frustrated that she’d said I’d never get to fuck her properly. I wanted my cock to be in her pussy so much. I fantasized about it so often. It was wonderful that I’d get to pleasure her when she ordered it. Getting to ravish her with my hands and tongue was far more than I could ever have hoped for. But I wanted more. I wanted her completely. And she was denying me that. Still, the thought of being held captive to every one of Beth’s whims and wishes was a big turn on. I’d surprised myself in discovering a real thrill in being dominated and controlled.
It was ten days after she caught me wearing her lingerie that Beth made her first demand beyond having me send her a picture of my cock in her panties each morning. She was only a few feet away, sitting at her desk opposite me, but the demand came via text:
Hubby away with the kids, come to my place this evening. Look in your bottom desk drawer. Bring it tonight. That’s what we’ll be wearing.
I was going to have to cancel dinner with my wife, but I didn’t have a choice. Ok I texted back, looking up and seeing a naughty smile on her face.
I pulled open the drawer. There was a parcel inside. I opened it to find two matching sets of La Perla underwear, one labeled Hers and the other His.
My mind was instantly racing. My cock swelled. The thought of both of us wearing the same lingerie was wonderfully arousing. I looked back up at Beth and smiled. I felt myself blushing. Wanted it to be home time already. Shit, I thought, still six hours to go.
Come 3pm though, Beth decided enough was enough. “Fuck it,” she said. “I can’t wait any longer. Let’s go now.”
I smiled. I smiled because I was desperate to be intimate with her again. But I smiled too because she’d displayed weakness. She was seriously into me. Even though she was playing her domination games with me, she wasn’t quite as in control as she might have thought. A plan was starting to form in my mind.
We drove separately from the office back to her house. She arrived a few minutes before me. The front door was ajar. “Shut the door and come upstairs,” she shouted as she heard me walking into the hallway. I went up to the bedroom. She was already getting undressed. The sight was intoxicating. “I’m just going to have a quick shower,” she said. “You’d better have your bra and thong on by the time I’m out.”
The arousal was immediate. The luxurious lingerie felt so wonderful on my skin. I slipped the silky thong up my legs and over my cock. It barely covered me at all. I couldn’t help but rub myself. I was consumed with desire, turned on by both Beth and this sensual lingerie.
“You’re not allowed to touch yourself, by the way,” Beth’s voice suddenly announced from the shower. I moved my hand away guiltily. How did she know?
I put the bra on and lay on her bed, waiting. A couple of minutes later she appeared, wrapped in a white towel that was barely big enough to cover her. She dried herself in front of me. Relishing the way I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.
Her breasts looked irresistible. A perfectly sized handful. I watched her nipples harden under the gaze of my longing eyes.
She reached for the matching lingerie I’d left laid out on the bed. Slowly, with her back turned away from me, she leaned forward to slip her thong on. She took her time, making sure I got a good view of her pussy.
“Enjoying the view?” she asked. I nodded. “Don’t forget though, because you were such a naughty boy, you will never get to put your cock in here,” she said, rubbing her fingers on her already wet pussy.
I nodded again. That’s what you think, I thought to myself.
Beth turned to face me, wearing nothing but the thong; her ample breasts hung freely. She let me fuck her with my mind for a few moments and then put on the bra and came to lie next to me.
“Last time I let you touch me with your hands and tongue,” she said, looking intently into my eyes. “Today, you only get to use your hands. And this.”
She reached over to the drawer next to her bed. Pulled out sex toy unlike any I’d seen before. It looked like something from a bygone era.
“I call this the Shiverator,” she told me. “Strap it to the back of your hand.”
I slipped it on. And then turned it on for a second or so. Whoa, I thought. I can see why someone would love this. It’s like my whole hand was suddenly turned into a vibrator.
“My hubby doesn’t like toys,” she told me. “You’ll be the first person to use this on me. I want you to blindfold me first though.”
I found one of her husband’s ties and bound it over her eyes. She lay back comfortably on the bed. God she looked so sexy. I still couldn’t quite believe she was letting me do this to her. Of course, I didn’t have a choice. But then again, I’d choose this every single day.
I switched on the strange looking contraption again. My whole hand started to tremble with the vibrations. I began with her feet. Very, very slowly, I worked my way up her legs, keeping my fingers well lubed with saliva. I took my time. Spent well over twenty minutes stimulating her body everywhere. Well, everywhere apart from where Beth wanted me most.
I could sense her desire rising and rising. Her body movements were begging me to touch her pussy with my vibrating fingers. I made her wait as long as I dared. Then I moved my fingers onto the lips of her dripping pussy. And then her clit. And then I penetrated her with my fingers.
Beth was rapidly losing control. I gently touched her pussy lips and clit with my thumb while my fingers slid inside her. My wife had never moaned like this. Beth was in a state of ecstasy I’d never witnessed before. With both hands I formed a V above her clit and massaged up and down her outer lips while my vibrating fingers dived deep inside her.
I was exploring, penetrating, rubbing and vibrating her. I found the perfect rhythm to match the increasingly urgent and erratic convulsions Beth’s whole body was making. I kept going. Steadily driving her more and more wild until she lost control. Her whole body shook in an earth shattering climax. Her hips bucked, her ass tightened and she exploded with an intensity I’d never seen before.
I’d never felt so aroused myself. I was desperate to fuck Beth. I needed my cock to be pounding her pussy. Driving her wild with my cock, not just my fingers.
As Beth lay there recovering, blindfold still on, I got up.
“Just going to the bathroom,” I lied.
Beth still couldn’t speak but made a vague noise indicating I wouldn’t be punished for leaving the bed.
I picked up my phone. Looked at the screen. Perfect, I thought. I got the angle just right.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Beth,” I said, confidently.
“Sorry, lingerie boy,” she replied. “You’re not allowed. Your punishment is that you never get to put your dirty little cock inside me.”
“I do now,” I replied.
She slipped off the tie that was covering her eyes. I pressed play on the video and turned the screen of my phone so she could see it. The look of shock on her face was a sight to behold.
“You bastard,” she said. But it wasn’t said angrily. She had a smile on her face. “I guess we’re even,” she said, laughing quietly.
“Yup.”
“The truth is, actually, I kind of regretted banning you from fucking me. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about you inside me ever since I caught you.”
I laughed. “I thought as much.” A fresh wave of lust washed over me. “Turn over.”
She obeyed without question, getting on her hands and knees. I moved behind her. Slid my cock straight into her pussy. Pulled myself tight to her body, thrusting my cock deep inside her. I moved my hands to cup her gorgeous tits. Squeezed them hard as I began, slowly at first, to fuck her.
Merely entering Beth’s pussy caused her to erupt a second time. Despite having come already, she was raring for more. As my cock slid inside her, I tipped her straight over the edge. It was like her whole being had been craving my cock and as soon as it pushed deep within her pussy, it was enough to trigger a wave of uncontrollable pleasure.
I rode the wave of her instant ecstasy and then, with my cock now fully immersed in her wet, hot pussy, we found our rhythm. I let out all my frustration at not having been able to fuck her until now and went for it like a man possessed. It was hard and fast. I felt almost out of control. No woman had ever driven me wild like this. I pinched her nipples. Softly at first. Then harder and harder as my thrusts became more urgent and desperate.
And then I burst. My whole body erupted. It was an explosion of pleasure as I shot my load deep inside Beth’s pussy. My body shuddered as a follow-up wave of pleasure hit me. I felt, in that moment, utterly complete.
Beth couldn’t help but react to the feeling of my load blasting into her. The feeling of my hot come deep inside her sent her soaring into ecstasy for a third time.
“That was so good,” I eventually managed to say.
“Hell yeah,” Beth replied. Before adding, “You need to eat me clean now though.”
I looked at her. A mix of my come and hers was dripping out of her pussy and down her thighs. I didn’t hesitate. Kneeling between her legs, I licked her clean, finishing off with a few gentle strokes of her clit with my tongue. And then she came for a fourth time.Call him Daddy, you won’t regret it!
“I’ve heard from a fair amount of men who were turned off by it, and were worried that it was an indicator of ‘daddy issues’,” says sex therapist Vanessa Marin. “Yes, ‘daddy’ can mean ‘father,’ but we also use the word to indicate when someone is the boss, in charge, a protector, or doing a good job.”
Preach, Vanessa! I am a part of that “we” conglomerate that she speaks of. I will call you daddy during sex and other times when I feel that you are killin’ it and the boss of this (insert fun vagina nickname) and only then. If you don’t get called daddy then you simply didn’t earn the name, sweetheart.
For the ones who think it may have something to do with daddy issues, let me explain. No one is trying to fuck their own dad, that is sick and twisted. You can be the daddy or be boss of other things: cooking, foot rubs, compliments (all things that I like) and I’ll let you know by giving you this well deserved title. If you really don’t get the correlation then you’ve never been the daddy of anything so you would never understand.
I asked several men how they would feel about being called daddy, and 1 out of 10 of the men felt weird about it. There is a large number of men who not only get it but fucking love it! And I mean love it in bed and outside of bed. Now don’t just go yelling daddy all night, there’s an art to this. You let the sex build up, get intense and when he starts giving those deep thrusts let him hear you moan, “YES DADDY!” He will be the happiest man on earth, and you hopefully will have climaxed and be one happy camper also!
Keep in mind, like with a majority of my topics, I always state that before you go ahead and try something new please communicate prior. What if the name calling is a turn off? Just hint at it one day and test the temp. I’m sure he won’t say no! I have even tried it on complete strangers and the reaction is priceless. The best one was a bartender, I tried to get an order with him for a long time; he finally comes over to get the order for me and my girls. When he delivers our drinks I say, “thank you daddy.” He stopped, gave this face…
said, “ohh, you’re welcome.” And he extra took care of us the rest of the evening.
Message here is that “Daddy” is a nice way to tell your man that he’s doing a great job. So give him that and see what you get in return ;)Juliett and Martha were wrapped around each other in a tight sixty-nine, eyes shut and breathing in gasps; Martha’s stiff little tongue tip flicking rapidly over Juliett’s tight slit, the folds engorged and dark red, shiny with her juices. On the other webcam Juliett was whipping Martha’s pink pussy lips with her fingers; Martha arched and sucked in air, holding her breath as her climax ignited within her hips and raced down her body, eyelids fluttering and legs shaking. She still managed to grip Juliett with fingers in her anus and a thumb on her clit. She squeezed hard and Juliett moaned, feeling her own orgasm surge and break when Martha bit her nipple and ground it with her teeth, hard. Juliett’s slender body flexed and she pawed at the bed until her spasms calmed down.
Juliett looked at the webcam and spoke: “If you think that was hot, just check out Jessica’s webcam later tonight!” She buried her tongue in Martha’s snatch as the screen went black.
Jessica led me into her small house and up the stairs to her room, gabbling, “You should see the screen lighting up, this is so exciting!” but all I could see were her jiggling butt cheeks hardly covered by some white cotton panties as she bounced up the stairs.
She had a big, loose t-shirt on over nothing, really; her large soft boobs with their fat nipples bouncing underneath every time she moved. She sat on the bed cross-legged in front of her laptop, staring and tapping on the keys. The screen gave her room a blue glow, balanced by some candles she had lit.
“So we’re going to perform whatever these guys ask, right? What have they asked for so far?” I sat on the bed and nuzzled her neck with my whiskery cheeks, then reached under her shirt and gently squeezed her breast, rolling the nipple between thumb and finger.
“Oh… lots of things,” she smiled. “I said ten of them have to agree on what they want before we’ll do it.”
“Tell them we have to start with foreplay.” My fingers caressed her mound through her panties. I could feel the moisture leaking through. I looked at the screen. “Looks like blindfold is number one, Jess. Ready, babe?”
She grinned back at me, a little nervous. I gripped her t-shirt with my fingers and teeth and tore off about a foot of fabric all the way around, revealing her slim waist and giving me something I could tie over her eyes.
“Can you see anything?”
“Nope, nothing.” Her voice was shaking a bit; she knew it was coming now but wasn’t sure from where. I leaned over and kissed her, her lips melting to mine, tongue luscious and lively, her sweet breath filling my head with hazy, intimate ideas. I crooked a finger under the waistband of her panties and ran it along her slit, feeling some drops leaking out. I spread the hood and circled her clit and her hips started to roll on their own. Jess was a vision, leaning back, her wet lips searching for mine, nipples hard beneath her old t-shirt.
“Jess we have another request: hot wax…”
“What the hell is that?”
“I pour candlewax on you. It’s hot but it cools as soon as it touches you and it sticks… pretty kinky. I’ll tell them no.” I reached for the keyboard.
“It’s okay Greg, I’ll try it. You know what to do, right?”
“Sure do.” She lifted her butt and I pulled her panties off. Her neat pubes were so sexy, wet folds steaming, aromatic with her sex. I licked the length of her slit, spreading her wet lips wide with my tongue. Her slim thighs brushed my scratchy cheeks and her hips thrust her pussy up to find my mouth. Her folds tasted delicious as I licked her tender flesh, her sweet girlish scent intoxicating. I almost forgot myself and finished her off, but as she began to squeeze me with her thighs I reached for a candle and looking up I poured a few drops over her left tit, just catching the puffy nipple.
“Aahhh!” Jess gasped and arched her back, squirming until the heat dissipated. Her eyes were wild, the mask pushed off now.
“Wow!” she sat up and cupped her breast. “It’s hot but it doesn’t burn.” Her fingertips peeled the wax up from her skin, which was marked in a red, cryptic pattern. She took the candle from me and drizzled it over her right nipple, closing her eyes and looking up, absorbing the pain. I took her left nipple in my mouth and licked the tender surface, soothing it and feeling it stiffen in response. She crushed her breast to my face, then withdrew and offered up her right nipple, marked in red. I pulled the wax off gently with my teeth and then spread my saliva over her nipple, feeling the heat from the hot wax still held by her skin.
I looked up at Jessica and she was breathing deeply, her eyes shut and leaning back, feeling my tongue on her nipple; she licked her lips and put her hand behind my head, holding me to her breast. I sucked it in gently, taking her whole fat nipple in my mouth and circling the hard tip.
Jessica shivered then and opened her eyes as if she were waking up. “What’s next?”
I scanned the screen. “They want me to tie you up now.”
“Awww, always me!” Her face brightened: “Let’s tie you up instead! I can do it, I know the knots!” She really wanted to.
“Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.” Her bed was so small my feet hung over the corners and she tied them down expertly so as to not cut off my circulation, then crept up to my groin and took me in her hands. She stroked me to stiffness and licked the head, blowing on it to make it sensitive, then took a candle and dripped wax along my shaft. I sucked in air and shook my head to clear the pain, pleading with my eyes.
Jessica had an evil look on her face, though. She slid on her belly up onto me and pressed her tits into my face. I closed my eyes and kissed and sucked on her warm flesh while she quickly hogtied my wrists and knotted them to the headboard.
“Wow, I’ve always wanted to do this!” She was straddling my stomach. Looking behind her, she saw me standing tall. “Looks like you’re loving it too…” She pulled the knot tight with a jerk.
“He’s feeling neglected…”
“Poor baby!” Jess spun around and was on me in a second, drawing me deep into her warm mouth, her glistening pussy just inches from my face.
“You should slide back a little, Jess.”
And then her warm folds were on my lips, reeking of sex and wet with her juices. I pushed my tongue inside her to lap up more of her delicious girl taste; I couldn’t get enough of it. Jessica paused to feel me licking her and leaned back a little. Then she pulled her firm cheeks apart and winked at me over her shoulder, squeezing and relaxing her anus.
“I’ve been wanting to feel you here all day. Don’t make me wait any longer…” She rolled her butt back on to my face, my nose between her cheeks and I licked her anus broadly, wetting it with my spit and feeling it soften and spread as she relaxed it. I had no problem inserting my tongue at least an inch, trying to screw it in a little deeper, breathing in her musky scent and drooling a little while I tongue fucked her asshole.
Then a second later she was gone until her lips found mine and we were making out.
“I wanted to taste you after you ate my ass,” she whispered. “Now it’s time for the main event. First I want to feel you inside of me…” Jessica lifted her hips up and pushed my glans along her slit. I could feel it spreading open and then I was inside her warmth. She slid down the shaft, so wet I was ready to fuck and I pressed upward; it was frustrating not to have much control.
Jessica moved slowly, pressing both hands on my chest as she lifted up and then sank down so slowly, pushing her tender folds down against me, taking all of me inside her; the tip of her tongue just parting her lips. She shuddered as she sucked in a lungful and held herself there. I flexed inside her, pressing upward and she shivered again.
“Oh! You feel so great!” She started rocking her hips and I felt her rhythm and tried to balance, so frustrated at being tied up. I wanted to rip the ropes off and throw her down on the floor to fuck her senseless; I was pulling at my bonds, thinking maybe I could get one foot free, but the knots were tight.
And she was getting to me. My joint was loving her heat; I was aching and stiff and craving release. I pushed into Jessica with powerful thrusts, as much as I could muster with arms and legs restrained. Damn the script, I was ready to blow.
Suddenly she lifted off and swung around, bottom facing me again. She reached down and raised her ass, guiding me to her wet anus, wiggled a little and I slipped inside.
“Ooh Greg, take it easy baby, I’m so sensitive since you licked me there,” she purred.
The cams were getting a show with Jessica’s knees in the air and her bottom bouncing off my hips with my joint in her ass, stroking like a piston. Despite her warning I wasn’t holding back, it just felt too good. Her pussy was on full display, the lips puffy and engorged, red and glistening wet. Her juice flowed down into her ass, greasing the passage for me.
“Jess, I want you to come. Spank your pussy for me!” I whispered and she wet her fingers inside and started whipping her clit, squeezing my shaft as she felt her climax building. I couldn’t see but only heard the wet spanking sounds and I chased my own climax, feeling it building while I thrust upward hard and then I let it go and her tight asshole got real warm and wet and soft.
We relaxed then. I was still moving slowly, just enjoying her warmth. “Jessica, lift your knees up,” I said, and she did, which spread her butt wide. I slid out of her ass, undamming the flow. Semen tricked out and down her cheeks and dripped into my pubes. The sharp smell of sex was in the air.
“I’ll give them one more little treat,” she grinned, and proceeded to scoop and lick the sticky drips of semen off of my shaft and balls, swallowing it and licking her lips. She giggled as she shut the laptop.
Later I made us grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, which we ate at her tiny breakfast table.
“Don’t you girls ever eat? You have close to nothing in your kitchen, this is all I could find!” Except for the apron I was wearing we were both naked and Jessica was sitting next to me with her legs on top of mine, wiggling her feet. She finished her sandwich and brushed crumbs off her tits, then started in on the rest of mine.
“I want to hire you to cook for me.”
“I don’t think you could afford me. Anyway my food tastes better when I’m doing it for love…”
Jess looked up at me with her big green eyes. “Stay with me tonight?”
“How will we both fit in that bed?”
“We’ll make it work,” she said with smiling eyes.
Truly we didn’t sleep much. We dozed off nice and comfy spooned in her bed, so warm; but then two hours later we were up and going at it again.Encounter, part two: Jane’s pursuit of pleasure
Mimi Bordeaux
Dec 12, 2016
Jane laces her boots up carefully, making sure the leather string goes through each hole. She’s excited again. Another night on the town, looking for Audrey: the one who introduced her to the orgasm, the pleasure and pain of bondage and most of all, love.
She has been searching London’s gay clubs ever since meeting Audrey, but has yet to find her. She remembers where Audrey lives though, and this is her next step.
Jane has been hiding her lesbian pornographic albums and journal just in case her mother decides to snoop around. But tonight, her mother catches her as she’s about to head out for the night.
“Darling, why are you wearing those terrible clothes? And just look at your hair!” her mother exclaims. Jane has recently acquired a number one shave, all over her scalp. So far she has been wearing scarves to cover it up.
“Mummy, it’s alright. I told you. It’s for a research fellowship.”
“Oh, ok my darling… But stay safe won’t you?” her mother replies, looking doubtful.
“Yes Mummy, I will.”
Jane runs down the drive to the waiting taxi. She jumps in the back seat and checks her watch. 9pm. Ok. It’s now or never. She gives the driver Audrey’s address and sits back. She’s taken up smoking so she enjoys a quick puff before the driver tells her to put it out.
“Damn you,” she says, under her breath.
She’s had quite a good time this past month. Picking up women. Going back to their place and fucking until daybreak; but she misses Audrey. So much. She’s learnt a lot since then. How to make herself cum. Toys. Other women’s pussies, their different aromas and tastes.
She’s learnt that you have to be clean and healthy to have sex… especially Audrey’s way.
The taxi pulls up at Audrey’s apartment, and guess who is walking out? It’s Audrey. Jane shoves a $50 bill in the driver’s hand and jumps out, hiding behind a tree.
Audrey stands there, looking just as glorious as Jane remembered her. She’s wearing another black dress, her hair down this time, and silver earrings that flash in the dark. Jane is tempted to run up to her but knows better. Audrey slides into a cab and off she goes. Jane looks back. Her cabbie is still sitting there. She jumps back in.
“Follow that cab, please.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” the driver says, disinterested.
Oh, she’s excited now and her panties are soaked through. Her whole focus is on Audrey. They drive for ten minutes before arriving at the very discreet entrance to a club. Jane watches carefully. Audrey gets in without a hitch.
Time for Jane to be brave. She pays the driver, walks to the door and says, “I’m with her.”
The tattooed female bouncer gives her the once over and moves aside to let her pass.
Jane can’t believe her luck. Now, the plan is to get Audrey on her own, to remind her how much fun they had and get invited back to that enticing red door. Oh, how Jane has dreamt of that red door and what happened inside. She sits at a table at the back for a moment; not good enough. She moves to the front and glances to her left, to find Audrey is staring at her.
Jane starts to fidget… she’s incredibly nervous. How will Audrey respond? She begins to think she’s made a huge mistake, but suddenly Audrey gestures towards to the exit. Jane nods. They meet at the door and Audrey pushes it open with gusto.
“What are you doing here?” she demands.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Jane responds. “I like you. Want another go?”
Audrey grabs Jane by the throat, hissing, “You what? Want another go?” Her face is furious.
“Yes,” Jane whispers.
Audrey lets go of her, looks her up and down and says, “Ok then. My place?”
Audrey slips into the taxi gracefully. She’s so elegant. Jane remembers their first encounter. She was so naive. Now she knows what she wants.
Audrey breaks the silence by saying, “Where did your hair go?”
“On the hairdresser’s floor,” Jane replies, suddenly feeling more sure of herself.
Audrey has an amused smile on her beautiful face as she looks out of the window. When they reach her place, she walks ahead of Jane, so Jane has a good look at her long legs and slim waist. She sits on the couch, no longer nervous.
“Pour yourself a drink,” Audrey says, going into her bedroom. Jane pours herself a whiskey on the rocks. It feels smooth as she sips and waits, wondering what Audrey will be wearing.
Finally, Audrey emerges; no leather mask, but she is wearing a giant black strap-on dildo. Jane’s stomach flutters and she instantly is aroused. She feels wetness between her legs.
Audrey takes her time, pouring herself a gin and tonic before she walks over and holds the dildo close to Jane’s mouth.
“Suck,” Audrey demands and Jane begins, holding the base and licking the tip, spitting on it and taking the whole thing in her mouth. Audrey looks down and moans her approval. Jane keeps swallowing the huge cock, running her tongue up the sides and licking with vigour.
After a few minutes, Audrey pulls away and says, “Turn around and stick out your ass so I can fuck you, dirty little slut.” Jane willingly does as she’s told, pulling her panties down and offering herself blatantly. Audrey grabs her by the waist and enters her wet pussy slowly. Jane lets out a big moan, loving the feeling of being filled.
Audrey starts to fuck her, slowly at first, pulling out, then entering again, speeding up the pace. Jane’s head is on a cushion, her ass high in the cool room. Audrey thrusts harder and Jane’s head starts to swim, desire and passion controlling her. Audrey is moaning, obviously enjoying Jane’s response.
“Faster!” Jane blurts out and Audrey rams the fake cock in to the hilt. She hits Jane’s G-spot over and over. Jane is sweating, gasping and moving to the rhythm. As she feels the wave of pleasure overwhelm her she yells, “I’m coming!”
“Come then, slut!” Audrey barks. Jane’s legs are trembling, sweat dripping down her body, her cum squirt coming as a surprise. Her breathing is heavy as she collapses onto the couch.
Audrey slaps her backside and says, “Good girl.” She pulls out the dildo and tells Audrey to lie back. She climbs on top of Jane, her sticky wet cunt resting on Jane’s thigh. Jane is so high with lust she is getting dizzy. Audrey leans down and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck and lips, biting the bottom lip hard. She moves up Jane’s body slowly, eventually sitting on Jane’s face. She is silent and Jane knows what is expected. She begins to lick Audrey’s clit, softly, as Audrey gasps. Jane slides her tongue into Audrey’s cunt, dipping in and out, then moving back to her clit.
Jane is so horny she starts to touch herself, her tongue putting more pressure on Audrey’s clit. Audrey’s juices trickle onto Jane’s face, and Jane feels like she will climax again. But she wants to come with Audrey, so she holds back.
Audrey is writhing her soaking pussy against Jane’s face, her moans getting stronger and louder. Jane slips a finger into Audrey’s cunt and keeps a steady rhythm on her clit. Audrey grabs Jane’s head, grinding forcefully, wailing, and Jane rubs her own clit hard. One more lick and Audrey and Jane both let out a massive holler, screaming out their mutual orgasms.
Jane continues to lick Audrey more gently, lapping up her juice until Audrey sinks back onto the couch. Both are breathing heavily, soaked and satiated. There is silence. After a short while Audrey mumbles, “Let’s get some rest now.” She turns her back and Jane tentatively puts an arm around her.
Jane dares to whisper, “I love you.” Audrey takes her hand.

I was sitting in the armchair sipping my scotch when he walked in, belt in hand. His bowtie was undone and dangled around the collar of his crisp linen tux. His owl-like hazel eyes pierced right through me.
“Your safe word is purple,” he smiled.
I didn’t respond, but internally acknowledged that our little game had begun. He took my glass away just before I could take my last sip. I immediately got angry. He knew I hated being controlled in that way. He sensed my pride.
“What is it?” he laughed. “Baby wasn’t done with her glass?”
My eyes answered for me with a glare.
He stood me up and kissed me gently. I was soothed by the softness of his lips. They sent shivers down my spine as they pressed around my tongue. Suddenly his hand swooped down to my ass and spanked it. My eyes flew open at the unexpected sting.
He turned me around and bent me over the armchair. He hiked up my gown and slid my black lace panties down to my knees.
I heard the belt snap. “You know you aren’t allowed to look at Daddy that way,” he said.
He spanked me harder, my right cheek getting more attention than the left, making the sting curve across my hip. I heard his zipper open, and got excited instantly. Now my left cheek was getting whacked, leaving my right cheek to throb with a rush of heat. My wriggling made my panties slide to my ankles.
He stopped for a moment; then I felt a long warm drip of his saliva hit right between my ass cheeks. He wrapped the belt around my neck and held it firmly from behind. The head of his cock smeared his spit up and down the crack of my ass. My arms started trembling, my breathing heavy. I thought he was going to fuck my ass until I screamed! Instead, he stood me up and unzipped my gown. It dropped to the floor and he turned me around to face him.
He kissed me softly again and unclasped my bra with one hand, pushing me back into the chair. He loosened the grip of his belt around my neck, the buckle resting on my chest. He slid his middle finger between my pussy lips.
“You’re not wet enough,” he declared, shaking his head in disappointment.
He grabbed my breasts and squeezed them together. I felt an instant rush of pleasure as soon as he sucked my nipples. He nibbled my left breast and then sucked on the right. I could feel my nipples harden against his tongue as he flicked them. He took the end of the belt and tapped my nipples until the sting overcame the pleasure. As soon as I arched my back he started to kiss them again, making it impossible for me to control my reactions. I couldn’t believe how horny I was getting. I imagined his lips sucking my clit the same way he was treating my nipples. I sneaked my hand down to play with my pussy. Of course, he noticed.
“Do you want Daddy to eat you?” he asked softly.
“Yes, please,” I whined. “I can’t take any more teasing, Daddy!”
I was now deep in my role as his naughty little cock slut. My voice changed from my usual ladylike tone, to a cum-hungry baby who could only manage obedient one-syllable whispers and gasps.
He knelt and hoisted my legs over his shoulders. He traced the insides of my thighs with his tongue and waved it across my flesh, deliberately ignoring my clit. My hips were squirming, trying to catch his mouth where I wanted it.
Finally, he gave me what I needed. His tongue whirled around my over-teased clit. He grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his hand, choking me. I was so close to coming! The more I shook, the slower he moved his tongue. I couldn’t even moan any more. The little breath I could suck in was just enough to feed my orgasm. I gripped the sides of the chair with all my might, chasing after my climax. One last, agonizingly slow whirl of his tongue set off a deep throbbing explosion from my pussy, making my chest sink. It was like my heart and my clit were competing against each other.
He dipped his fingers inside me and looked closely at the juice trickling down his hand.
“Good girl!” he said, smiling. He thrust his fingers in my mouth, making me taste myself. I licked his fingers and swallowed my sweetness. I could feel his engorged cock growing against my thigh and reached down to grab it, but he pulled away.
He bent me over again. I was dripping wet from my orgasm. He kicked my panties away and spread my legs wider. He wrapped the belt around his hand, so it gripped my neck even tighter than before. At last, he leaned in and spread my pussy lips apart with the head of his cock. When he finally surged inside me, my whole body was tingling. His thick cock thrust deeply, hammering my G-spot. I could feel another orgasm rising.
He took his cock out of my pussy and squeezed it into my ass, slowly and deliberately. He didn’t even have to thrust for me to moan and scream! The unexpected insertion had my inner walls trembling.
He pulled out and put his cock back in my pussy. I got even wetter. He kept alternating between my pussy and my ass, giving each a few hard stokes until I couldn’t hold it in any more. When he stuck his prick in my ass again, I reached down and rubbed my clit ferociously, coming all over my fingers. A gushing stream of fluid sprayed down my thighs and all over the floor.
I collapsed forward, feeling dizzy and disoriented, my hand still cupped tightly over my pussy. He kissed my back and shoulders, sliding his cock out of my ass and pressing it against the back of my thigh. I could feel it throbbing.
“Turn around so I can cum on that pretty little face,” he said.
I sat and just barely slid the tip of my tongue over the head of his cock…
“Purple,” I said, with a smile.
Then I went over to the drinks cabinet, poured myself another glass of scotch, and walked out of the room.
Follow MyErotica for refined erotic fiction to ignite your deepest desires.Shallow breaths
As she steps closer
His chest rises and falls
Swallowing
The anticipation that floods his mouth
Her voice
Hypnotic and low
Binding him to her
A deep, shuddering inhale
As her nails lightly drag
Down the front of his throat
As they journey to his chest
The force intensifies
And red trails are left in their wake
A muted gasp
As twin metal clamps
Sink into tender nipple flesh
The chain between them
Symbolic
Of his status in her world
The only world that matters
Spine and cock stiffening
As her fingers glide downward
He widens his stance in response
To her light slap on his inner thigh
Suddenly she moves
So that her body is close
He tries not to think
About the softness of her breast
As it presses against his arm
Warm breath caresses his ear
As she murmurs
“I believe that you brought an offering?”
The tone self-assured and casual
She is well acquainted with the power
That she holds
Incapable of words, he nods
And trembling hands extend
Offering…
Equally afraid that she will accept
And that she will not
She deftly plucks
The Kali’s Teeth from his palm
Along with the accompanying lock
And steps back
Observing him with a smile
“What is it that you offer?”
“Say it.”
Teeth tug at his lower lip before
The answer rips out of him.
“Please. Please accept
My ch-ch-chastity.
Do with me what you will.”
The words harsh and brittle
As they hang in the air between them
Both of them aware
Of the raw need
Pouring out of him like
Blood from an open wound
A crescendo of laughter
Her response
To his soul
Filleted bare
She steps forward
Gripping his face lightly
Her eyes like magnets
Pulling him into her
He
Tumbles effortlessly
Into the universe
Comprised
Of
Her gaze
“Do with you what I will?
“I believe that’s a road already traveled…”
She speaks breezily
As her hand drops from his face
To his cock that is extended
In the space between them
A barely audible moan
As her fingers encircle
First, the cool touch of her skin
Then followed by the steel
Of the chastity device
Summoning him with her eyes once again
A challenging look
Then with no words
And a faint sound
As the brass padlock clicks home
Stepping back to admire her handiwork
She lifts her arms and pulls
A fine, tightly woven gold chain necklace
Over her head
The tiny key dangling from it
Coming to rest between the swell of her breasts
She moves toward him again
Intoxicating Goddess on the prowl
Teasing her nails over the head of his shaft
Knowing that it will respond
And that as it does
The steel teeth inside the ring
Will bite
She revels in that knowledge
And extends her tongue to
Slowly lick up the right side of his neck
Tilting her pelvis against him
Eyes glittering as she hears another moan
She begins to speak casually
Tormenting him
Telling him of the fine orgasms she had that morning
Alone with her toys
Keeping her body close to his
Luring him deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
Unable to not respond
His cock
Expands and contracts
Expands and contracts
Again and again
In a maddening circle
As she tempts him to fullness
The teeth of the device
Sink into his erection
Chasing it away
Pearlescent tears of frustration weep
From an appendage that belongs
Totally to her
As
Does
HeThe first time, I was pretty sure I was seeing things. I was in my towel, fresh out the shower, ready to pick my undies before heading out for my uni class in town. Deciding what to wear, I had this vague, mostly subconscious sense that my bras and panties weren’t quite laid out how they were the previous morning.
The second time, I was convinced someone had been in my panty drawer. Some of my panties and thongs we definitely not arranged how I’d left them.
I felt pissed. Which of my housemates was going through my personal stuff? There were five of us living together. Two girls, three guys. None of them seemed the sort who’d go through my lingerie. Then again: how would I know?
The third time I caught him. Sat on my bed, with my favorite black lace panties wrapped around his cock. He was pumping himself hard and fast.
“What the fuck, James?” I said angrily, turning on the light.
“Shit,” was all he managed. And then again: “Shit.”
I’ve never seen anyone look so panicked. Deer in the headlights didn’t come close to it.
He took my panties off his cock, left them on my bed, and zipped himself back up. Then, unable to look me in the eyes, he walked straight past me, head down, and up to his top floor bedroom.
Two hours later I was lying in bed, unable to sleep.
The anger had subsided. Bizarrely, the initial feelings of violation had now turned to intrigue.
I’d never thought of any of my housemates as anything but friends. And now suddenly I couldn’t help but think about James differently.
He was into me.
My thoughts lingered for a moment on seeing his cock.
Out of nowhere, I felt a slight shudder of pleasure go through me thinking about my sexiest panties wrapped around it. Without even realizing, my hand had slipped down between my legs.
What was I thinking? I was shocked at myself. I wanted to feel angry again. That was the normal response I should be having. Right? But I couldn’t get the anger back. Suddenly the whole thing felt thrilling.
Before I could stop myself, I picked up my phone. And I texted him.
“Next time, just ask, okay?”
My heart was racing. What was I doing? I felt instant regret.
Then I heard my phone beep.
“Next time?”
Out of nowhere I felt this longing to see his cock again. With my panties wrapped around it. I wanted to watch him do it.
“How about now?” I wrote impulsively.
“?” he replied instantly.
Did I really want to do this? What was I getting myself into?
Fuck it, I thought.
“Come down and play with my panties again…while I watch,” I texted.
My left hand was rubbing my clit through my panties as I typed on the phone with my right. I hadn’t felt turned on like this in ages. Maybe never quite like this.
My phone beeped again.
“Are you serious?”
I found myself getting almost annoyed at his hesitancy, firing off an instant reply.
“Yes! Now get the fuck down here already.”
I heard the floorboards creak. His room was directly above mine. And then his slow footsteps down the stairs. He knocked gently on my door. Walked in, smiling sheepishly.
He didn’t know what to say.
“I want to watch you jerk off in my panties,” I told him, suddenly feeling bold in a way that surprised me.
I lifted the bedcover off and moved so I was sitting on top of it instead. I indicated for him to come and sit next to me. He was still fully dressed and clearly nervous. I found it quite endearing. And it made me want to take charge like I never had before.
“Take your jeans and boxers off,” I told him.
He could hardly look at me, but did it immediately. I smiled when I saw his cock. So big and hard. Maybe he was nervous, but he was as turned on as I was.
“Now take my panties off for me.”
He looked at me, stunned. I could tell he was about to come out with this ‘are you serious’ line again, so I didn’t let him.
“Yes, I’m serious. Take them off. I want you to use these when you jerk off.”
I knelt up. He moved towards me. He slid his hands up the outside of my thighs, under my short nightdress, and up to my black panties. Yes, the ones I’d caught him playing with before.
Feeling his hands on me was mesmerizing. It was tempting to just have sex. But I was determined to watch him play with himself in my panties.
He peeled my panties off me. Instinctively he moved them straight to his face. I totally got off on watching him sniff my panties. I’d never even thought about anything like this and now it was driving my imagination wild.
Then he took my panties and, while looking into my eyes, wrapped them around his oh-so-delicious looking cock.
Instantly he let out a quiet moan as he touched himself for the first time.
I felt so wet that I was sure I was dripping.
I watched him rub himself slowly with my panties. I wasn’t even sure why this was such a turn on. But it was.
I sat on my bed, back to the wall, and parted my legs. I began to play with myself as he sat on the side of my bed rubbing himself harder and faster.
When he turned and saw me, his eyes widened.
“Fuuuucck,” I heard him whisper.
I could tell he was about to come soon.
I was desperate to see him come all over my panties. I don’t even know why. But I wanted it so badly. Needed it.
And then he did.
His body convulsed in front of me. And I watched as he came, covering my panties. I felt myself getting close to my own orgasm now too.
Another thought flashed into my mind.
“Lick my panties,” I told him. “I want to watch you lick your own cum out of my panties.”
James was so turned on he would have done anything.
And he did.
I watched him lick my panties, feeling more aroused than ever in my life.
“Now come and lick me.”
He didn’t hesitate. He lay between my legs, and moved his mouth to my pussy. I grabbed his head, pulling him tight towards me.
It didn’t take long. I was ready. Barely a minute after his tongue moved around my clit, I was ready to explode.
I squirted all over his face.
I’d never squirted before.I expect my Master soon
and knowing His pleasures, I must
prepare myself for His arrival.
I see myself reflected,
corsetted tight and waist nipped in
black, the way He wants me.
I look to check that
seams are straight and too high heels that
thrust my body into provocation.
I scent the room and
light soft candles, making shadows play upon
the body that will be His to use.
I find His ballgag and
part my lips to take it deep, and tighten the strap
so my cheeks bulge with violation.
I ensure His whip is hanging
where He may reach it when need arouses
and mark me in ways He pleases.
I caress the steel of cuffs
between my fingers, wanting to see them
glittering against yielding skin.
I feel compulsion in His iron bed
that will welcome my spread-eagled body
each shackle open with invitation.
I reach down to encircle ankles
to hear the sound of metal closing
moistening me wide for surrender.
I strain above my head to reach the bars
stretched tight is the way He wants me, I must
tighten steel upon my wrists.
I am here for Him now
knowing not when He will come, only that desire
will grow with the waiting.
I can only stare upwards
knowing that when He comes,
I will be only His.
101 Poems for kinky lovers, by Francesca Anderssen is available in paperback and on the Amazon kindle marketplace.Take me as your very own
tie me as your love demands
use me now and use me fully
force me down to your commands
I need to know your chains upon me
such craving there will always be
to want your ropes to hurt my body
so your bonds will set me free
Submission is my total needing
wanting you to make it so
taking me to places strangely
where I cannot help but go
You’re the one who now must hold me
I’ve sold myself to your control
with my freedom gone forever
now that you possess my soul
So tie me tighter yet and tighter
my screams must bite the gag you give
use my mind to make me suffer
this is how I want to live.

Mimi Bordeaux
Nov 7, 2016
Audrey is sitting in a cocktail lounge. She’s sipping her Cosmo, thinking to herself, ‘I deserve a night out. I work hard. It will be nice to enjoy a few drinks.’ She’s happy with her attire and looks elegant. She’s wearing a little black dress with a strand of pearls and her hair is tied up in a French roll.
A plain looking girl enters the bar. She never goes to bars but tonight she’s decided to be adventurous as it’s a warm summer evening. As she walks in she looks around nervously for an empty table. She is thinking, ‘I want to have an encounter… with anyone.’ She has never been in a proper relationship and at 26 she thinks it’s time.
She’s ordering her drink at the bar — a Shirley Temple — when she notices the elegant woman sitting there. Audrey is lost in her own thoughts, but her interest is piqued by Jane’s request for the non-alcoholic drink. She swings her bar stool around to look at her.
Jane summons up the courage to blurt out, “Oh hello… do you come here often?” She feels like a fool for her clichéd opening gambit, but she continues anyway. “I don’t usually go to bars, but here I am.”
Audrey coolly replies, “I like to go out alone and have a few drinks by myself.” She looks Jane up and down, notices that she’s actually rather sweet looking despite her plain clothes, senses her air of barely contained excitement. Her tone becomes warmer. “It’s quite dull here actually. How about you come back to my place and tell me all about yourself?”
“There’s not much to tell,” Jane says nervously, but before she really knows what’s happening she’s agreed to go back to Audrey’s place anyway.
It’s not far by taxi to Audrey’s luxurious apartment. ‘Oh, this is exciting!’ Jane thinks to herself. She still lives with her mother in an ordinary suburban house. Audrey offers her a drink and tells her to make herself comfortable, while she gets changed. She disappears through the double doors leading to her bedroom. Jane looks around; she’s never seen such opulence and she thinks Audrey must be very worldly.
Audrey returns. She has been busy putting on her outfit. She stands there, imposing, looking even taller in fishnet stockings and thigh high leather boots with spike heels. Her black corset barely contains her voluptuous breasts. She is wearing a dog collar around her neck and a black leather mask. She holds a black whip which she flicks every second.
She stares at Jane and says, “Go through that door,” gesturing towards a red leather door off the bedroom with the whip. Jane’s heart is racing. She’s apprehensive but excited by Audrey’s domineering tone. She does as she’s told and enters the room with Audrey following, flicking the whip at her behind. First softly, then a hard crack that stings Jane’s buttocks.
Jane perches on a stool in the middle of the room, the only place to sit, and glances around at her surroundings. Chains, ropes and leather straps hang from the ceiling and walls. She shivers at the sight.
Audrey slams the door shut and barks, “Did I give you permission to sit down?” Jane is confused. Audrey walks toward her, flicking the whip, and stands over her. “Open your legs.” Jane does as she’s told. “Are you getting wet? You must be excited.” Jane squirms, feeling wetness between the tops of her thighs. She’s never felt this way before. There’s a tingling sensation she can’t fathom. It’s because of Audrey.
Jane looks up. Audrey is staring at her and in a second has Jane’s head in her hands. She swipes her tongue up Jane’s cheek then to her mouth, biting hard on the lower lip. She rolls her tongue around Jane’s lips and forcefully enters her mouth, her tongue pushing in deep, grabbing onto Jane’s tongue with her teeth.
Audrey kneels, pulls Jane’s skirt and panties off and moves her head between Jane’s legs. Jane is quivering and needs to hold onto something but there’s nothing except Audrey. She puts her hands on Audrey’s head, winds her fingers into the elegantly coiffured hair. Audrey licks all the way from Jane’s asshole to her clit. She sticks her tongue in Jane’s cunt. In out, in out. She does it over and over again, licking Jane’s whole crack and tongue-fucking her deeper and deeper. Then she focuses on Jane’s clit, licking more softly.
Jane is overwhelmed by the attention and instinctively opens her legs wider. Audrey sucks and nibbles on her swollen clit, licking voraciously. Jane’s head is swimming, she thinks she may faint and her legs are trembling uncontrollably. There’s a fluttering in her stomach like an eel spinning around. She’s sweating, her chest is burning and her face is flushed. She’s on the verge of something, a sensation she’s never felt before. It’s building up from her toes, up her legs; between them she feels a gush of fluid. Suddenly she throws her head back, straining, her eyes tight shut; she grabs Audrey’s head and makes a high-pitched involuntary screech. She can’t think, see or hear any more, but she’s screaming out her pleasure as she slides off the stool.
“Shut up!” Audrey says harshly, pulling her to her feet and leading her by the neck to some ropes hanging from the ceiling. She ties Jane’s hands tightly and tells her to bend over. Jane is giddy, but she does as she’s told. There’s a sound behind her, then she feels something touching her cunt. It thrusts inside her, going right to the hilt, then out again. It goes in again and starts to move slowly, in out, in out. Jane moans as the thrusting becomes more intense.
Now it’s moving more quickly, sending waves of heat up Jane’s body. She moans and whispers, “Yes… oh yes!” as Audrey pumps her cunt with force. Audrey slams the dildo in, pressing at a special spot that has Jane intoxicated. Jane can’t hold back any longer and yells out, clutching at the rope, sweat dripping from her forehead, her cunt soaking wet and squirting juices that dribble down her thighs.
Audrey turns Jane around and thrusts the dildo into her mouth, making her gag for a moment before she adjusts to its size. “Suck!” says Audrey sternly. The dildo is coated with cum and Jane tastes her own juice for the first time.
Audrey unties Jane’s wrists and buckles a dog collar around her neck, with a short leash attached. She leads her to a wooden table. “Bend over and put your ass in the air, slut,” she commands her. The words have an instant effect on Jane, who feels her cunt swell and throb, more wetness trickling down her thighs. She’s so turned on.
Audrey holds onto the leash and rubs her finger against Jane’s asshole. Jane feels something cold and sticky being spread over her, and then Audrey’s fingertip wriggling into her ass. It feels strange, but good. The finger goes a little deeper, and then suddenly thrusts all the way inside. She yells.
“Shut up, slut,” Audrey says, adding a second finger and pumping them in and out of Jane’s ass. Jane lies flat against the table, ass up, and takes it. She starts to like it. She moans with each stroke.
“You like that do you, my little slut?” Audrey says, going deeper and faster. Jane is dizzy with excitement, growling and howling. Her orgasm fires through her whole body, radiating out from her core.
After a few minutes Audrey withdraws her fingers and Jane slumps down onto the table, exhausted. Audrey grabs the leash, making Jane stand, then removes the collar. She stares at Jane. She grabs her head and swipes her tongue up Jane’s neck, then kisses her on the mouth.
“Time for you to go home,” she says. “You know the way out.” She marches Jane to the red door and pushes her through it, throwing her clothes after her. Jane dresses rapidly and staggers to the front door. Her pussy and ass are throbbing as she runs down the stairs. She’s floating. She feels like a bird in flight. She begins to walk.This girl looks exactly like me. The same long, wavy blonde hair. The same blue-grey eyes, the sprinkling of freckles over the bridge of her nose. The same slender fingers, moving to my nipple, as mine move to hers. We could be twins.
Only the tattoo on my back and the one on her foot mark us apart. She laughs when she undresses me and sees mine.
“Maybe I need to get one like it,” she says, getting down on her knees to kiss it, lick it; her tongue moving lower, down the cleft of my ass.
We met earlier that night, in a bar.
Coming face to face, I think for a moment that I’m walking into a mirror. We stare at each other for a long while, fascinated.
Before long we’ve both ditched our dates and are huddled in a corner, insulated from the noise of the bar by our absorption in each other. We’re drunk on the sight of each other, cataloguing the myriad points on which we are the same and the few tiny differences, obsessively.
“You’re just like me,” we keep telling each other.
When she asks my name and I say, ‘Narcisse,’ she laughs delightedly, getting the reference at once: Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection and died for love of himself.
She tells me hers is ‘Belle,’ which I know means beautiful; I’m not sure whether or not she’s lying but I like the inference, so I call her Belle anyway.
A little later and we’re sitting so close she’s practically on my lap, kissing avidly.
“Bet you’d fuck yourself if you could, wouldn’t you?” she says.
“Of course I would. Wouldn’t you?” She nods, unabashed. “Want to find out what it feels like?”
She nods again, runs a fingertip up my thigh as she leans in to whisper, “Your place or mine?”
My place then, the bedroom lights blazing so we can see every minute detail of each other as we undress, touch, explore. Every inch of her body looks strangely familiar. I lick each smooth expanse of skin as I uncover it, mapping the territory as I go, noting each hair and freckle. She shivers with arousal as I kiss her neck and then on downward, cupping a breast and sucking the nipple; she moans and I feel it harden against my tongue. Her responsiveness pleases me and my own nipples stiffen in sympathy, as if what I’m doing to her is physically mirrored in my own trembling flesh. I suck harder, my hands encircling her waist and running down over her hips.
I kiss and lick my way down her taut stomach, feeling it ripple at my light touch, then slide her panties down to her thighs and gaze at her pussy, enthralled. A neat tuft of blonde curls crowns her smooth, plump-lipped cunt. It’s like looking at myself from an angle I’ve never experienced before. I stare and stare until the intensity makes her fidget and she breaks the spell by pulling me onto the bed, breathless and flushed.
“What do you like?” she asks; meaning: how shall I get you off?
“You know what I like,” I reply, meaning: we’re the same. I like what you like.
Turns out I’m both right and wrong. She starts out gentle and teasing, kissing and licking around the edge of my skimpy panties, sucking my inner thigh, then licking me through the thin fabric until I’m dripping. By the time she peels my panties off and skims a fingertip along the slippery groove between my lips, I’m fighting the urge to tell her faster, harder, fuck me now! But it seems the teasing is what I wanted after all. Her touch is insistent, hypnotic, a slow build to a long drawn-out orgasm that has me screaming when she finally lets me come with three fingers plunging into my drenched hole and her lips suctioned around my clit.
I roll her onto her back and straddle her, kissing her insatiably, licking my cream from her lips. Pulling back to look into her eyes, I’m giddy with lust. For one vertiginous moment I feel as if I’m falling into a mirror, fucking myself into insanity.
Now all I can think about is tasting her. I spin around into a sixty-nine so I can hover my pussy over her face, too sensitive from my orgasm for much contact but shivering with arousal as she flicks her tongue delicately over my folds. My approach is more direct, more brutal; she’s shown me how she likes to be touched and now I’m teaching her my way. Spreading her open with my fingers, I swipe my tongue across her clit, over and over, relentless. My elbows pin her knees apart, my weight pinioning her so however much she squirms, she can’t escape the overpowering sensations. When she’s moaning and babbling deliriously, her hips juddering as she tries to hump up against my tongue, I thrust two fingers from each hand inside her, stretching her open and curling them to seek out her G-spot. Her hips buck so hard she nearly throws me off her as she comes, soaking my hands. She tastes just like me and that thought, coupled with the way she sucks fiercely at my cunt as she loses it, makes me come again.
We lie facing each other, and gaze into each other’s eyes, absorbing this information, the new things we’ve learned about ourselves from each other.
“I never knew I could come like that,” she says, wonderingly.
“I never knew I liked to be teased so much,” I laugh. She reaches for me again, kissing me hard as she slides one leg between my thighs, hooking the other over my hip. A little shuffling and we’re grinding together, pussy to pussy, both so hot and wet. There’s just enough friction to drive me out of my mind, my clit throbbing as I rub against her, hips moving in tight circles. This time, coming feels like hurtling down a long, dark tunnel into an explosion of light. I don’t know if the hammering against my chest is her heart or mine. The sense of consummation is profound.
We’ve been kissing and fingering, licking and sucking and fucking each other for so many hours it’s daylight when we finally disengage, blissed out and exhausted.
“Can I see you again,” she asks.
“You’ll see me every time you look in the mirror,” I reply.Watching your wife get fucked by another man is a real thrill, there is no doubt about that. But there are some cucks who want to take it even further. How can you go further than fucking? Cucks like me, we don’t just want our wives to cheat on us with their bodies. What we long for, more than anything else, is for our wives to develop real feelings for the bull.
It is called emotional cuckoldry. And it is not for the faint of heart. It is for people who are willing to really test their own inner strength. Maybe you suspect that it would be nice to watch your wife falling for another. I mean, it brings the excitement of competition to the surface, after all. But then, your heart gets kind of stamped on as she reveals to you the truth — that not only does he have a bigger cock than you, but he has also managed to awaken a real heart connection in her. Yes, that’s exciting too. But it is also incredibly scary. It means she might leave you.
And this is the real juice.
We emotional cuckolds must have had some abandonment issues in the past. And this fear of abandonment somehow is fused in our psyche with eroticism. So when the idea that our wife might leave first presents itself, the lump we feel in our throat is like nothing else. It unearths a desire and an excitement in us that is reckless — almost unlawful. Certainly taboo. We are not supposed to enjoy this. We must be masochistic, though, because we do. It hurts so good. So good.
It first happened to me with Ben, a guy that my wife had started fooling around with at work.
I knew she had a crush on him, that much she had confessed to me. But she hadn’t told me any of the details. I had assured her it was OK for her to pursue this crush, but she didn’t trust me, I guess. But finally, we had a date night, planned a week in advance, and I was able to get some of the details out of her.
It was dinner at The Corner Place, our favorite casual but awesome Italian. I waited until we had both ordered and had sipped a little red wine. Then I hit her with it.
“So, Lexy,” I said. “I’ve known you for a long time. You know, three years before we even started dating. Three years of dating. One year of marriage. That’s seven years.”
“Uh huh. Good math skills.”
She’s funny, I’ll give her that.
“I know you honey,” I said. “You can’t, you know…”
“I can’t what?”
“Well, I know you. And I would know if you weren’t, you know, telling me everything…”
“Oh, can we not talk about Ben tonight,” she said. “Can we just have a date night, me and you. Without Ben.”
“Of course.”
Shut down.
She shut me right down. Now I had to sit with these feelings. She was totally cheating on me. I mean, I knew she was cheating on me. But even this, being totally cheated on by the person who was cheating on me, by her withholding the details. Even this, I loved it.
It was a tortuous but lovely feeling.
We got through the whole date night. Got in bed, and I started making love to her. And as I was going down on her, I said, “Mmm, this tastes so good.” And then I just coyly asked her, “Has Ben tasted how good this tastes?”
“Mmmhmmm,” she murmured.
“I’m sorry,” I said, between licks of her clit. “Was that a yes?”
“Mmmmhmm,” she said.
“When did the lucky boy taste that?” I said, coming up for air.
“A couple days ago,” she gasped; she was almost ready to climax now. “We went back to his apartment at lunch. He wanted to fuck me. But I couldn’t.”
“So he just ate you,” I said.
“Mmmhmmm.”
“Did you cum?”
“Mmmhmmm.”
“And…”
“Oh shut up, I’m going to cum!”
And I concentrated on my work and made her cum real well. Then she went down and started reciprocating on my cock.
“Ah, and has Ben been as lucky as me in this regard?” I asked.
“Oh Jesus,” she said. “I’m trying to suck a dick here. Are you going to interrogate me or do you want a blow job?”
“Just nod or shake your head. Have you sucked his dick?”
She nodded.
I felt so good then. We were complete again. We weren’t holding anything back.
“Was it a nice dick?”
She shrugged her shoulders, then she nodded. I guessed it was a pretty nice dick.
“Bigger or smaller than mine?”
She made a kind of sing-songy noise. I didn’t hear it at first. But when she repeated it, I took her to be sing-songing “a little bigger.”
“A little bigger?”
She nodded.
“That’s good. That’s very good.”
It was so good in fact that I shot my load right then.
She was pissed.
“Josh!” she said. “I wanted to get fucked! I really wanted you to fuck me on our date night. Damn it.”
She got in bed next to me. But she wasn’t the one who should be pissed. It was her fault. She’d never told me this. And then, to find it out this way, through my subterfuge, it was all so exciting, I couldn’t help myself when I finally saw her nodding and admitting to a blow job. I just came like crazy.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” I said, finally asking the question that had been hanging between us.
“I’m sorry honey,” she said. “I just…I just didn’t feel like…you know, going through the details…I wanted it to be something…private, between me and Ben. Just this one private thing. I mean, I think that’s all it’s ever going to be. I don’t think I can bring myself to fuck him. So he ate my pussy and he made me cum and I sucked his cock and I made him cum, but–”
“Did he cum in your mouth?”
“See,” she said.
“See what?”
“This! I mean, I thought we could do this, Josh. I thought you could be…cooler about it. But maybe you can’t…handle it, I don’t know. I am going to call the whole thing off.”
“No! I can handle it!” I panicked. I was anxious that she was going to call the whole thing off. That was the last thing I wanted. “I don’t want you to call it off.”
It was then that she just broke down crying like crazy. I thought it was all my fault.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” I said to her. But through her blubbering, I gathered that it wasn’t my fault.
“What is it, then?” I asked.
“Oh, Josh,” she said. “I am so sorry. But…I think I’m falling in love with him. I’m sorry!”
“In love with Ben?”
“Yes,” she cried. “I’ve had a crush on him for months, yes. But now that we have been fooling around, Josh, I feel different with him, to how I feel with you. I’m so sorry. I feel…in my heart for him, something that I guess I didn’t know was there. But I think that’s what you’re supposed to feel in your heart for someone you fuck. I guess I shouldn’t have married you because I don’t feel that in my heart for you. I am so sorry. Oh God, I am so sorry about this. But it’s been driving me crazy and I’ve just got to be honest and tell you.”
“Tell me what?” I asked.
“I don’t love you, Josh,” she said, through a river of tears. “I’m sorry, I just don’t!”
When I woke up, she was packing a bag.
“What?” I said. “What are you doing?”
“What do you think I’m doing? Did you not hear what I told you last night? Were you drunk?”
“No,” I said. “I heard everything.”
“Then you know, that’s why I’m packing. I don’t love you, Josh. I’ve got to move out.”
“No you don’t,” I said. “That’s the last thing I want.”
“Right. You want to be married to someone who doesn’t love you? How fucked up is that?”
“Well, you might think it’s fucked up,” I said. “But Lexy, you know…it’s perfect for me. In so many ways. I mean, you know my upbringing…you know what I’m used to. My family didn’t love me. They didn’t even want me. So this is exactly what I’m comfortable with. I am just glad that it’s finally out in the open. I mean, you don’t think I knew that you didn’t love me? I mean, on our wedding day you were practically making out with Srivanda out on the balcony. I saw that, you know? The reason I picked you, unconsciously or consciously, must be because I have never felt loved and I wanted to continue that with my adult family.”
“So you want to stay with me, even though I don’t love you?”
She looked at me in disbelief.
“Yes,” I cried. “I love you more than ever now. This is what I want. Unrequited love. I want to suffer. I love it.”
“You love it.”
“Oh my God, if I could somehow let you experience what I experienced last night when you confessed this all to me. If you had been able to feel my chest, the compressions there. It was so intense. And then the back of my throat. It was such a pressure. And in my balls and my cock. I started almost cumming in my pants as you detailed how much you had been faking it, and how you really didn’t love me at all. It was so intense. It was painful and for some reason, the most pleasant feeling I have ever felt. After you went to sleep last night I went to the bathroom and I beat off ten times, I was so horny. Looking at you now, I think I’m going to cum again, just seeing your loveliness, and knowing that you don’t want me — it gives you an unbelievable power, don’t you see. You’ve become…Cleopatra. Royal. Beautiful beyond belief. You’ve become divine. A Goddess I can serve, but never equal. You’ve become…my dream come true.”
She looked at me like I was totally out of my mind.
“Wow, she said. “I did not…expect that.”
She put down her bags.
“So you want me to stay?”
“Yes!” I said. “Please stay.”
“Alright,” she said, looking bewildered. “I’ll stay. For now anyhow.”
And that’s how I became an emotional cuckold. My wife didn’t tell me details about her sex with her boyfriend any more. She shared details about her emotional connection with him. How he made her feel all girlie and excited. She took me shopping when she wanted to buy him a special gift. She wrote me emails and even handwritten letters about what a crush she had on him, how sexy he was, and how wonderful and special a person he was. She drew little hearts. She put her name and his name inside the heart. She took loads of special selfies of the two of them hugging and she sent them all to me. She shared herself and her affair with me totally. Even more than totally. I had the feeling that she was exaggerating a lot of it just because she understood me so perfectly. She knew that the worse she made it for me, the more jealous and shut out I felt, the more excited I got. And she took me there. All the way. She gave me the ultimate thrill. She made me into an emotional cuckold.
My wife. I love her so!I’m walking behind this girl in skintight yoga pants as she leaves the gym, watching her ass shimmy with every step she takes. I’m so mesmerized by the ripple effect that I barely even notice where I’m going. Does my ass jiggle like that when I walk? I can hardly grab it in the street to find out, but it doesn’t feel like it does. Now I’d like to grab her ass and feel her flesh bounce and shake as she sits on my face…
She goes into a coffee shop, and I follow, suddenly seized by a craving for caffeine (and pussy). She sits at a table by the window, catches my eye and smiles invitingly. I’m surprised I don’t recognize her — I thought I knew all the hot girls at my gym — but when I ask if I can join her, the effusive response makes it clear she’s noticed me before.
The morning’s progression is no less enjoyable for being entirely predictable. I’m in my comfort zone here, seducing cute girls being one of my favorite pastimes. Another coffee? Flirtatious chat. Her hand brushes my thigh as she leans across me to reach for the sugar, and she lets it linger there for a moment. Lunch? She lives nearby, she could make us something to eat…
I’ve been looking forward to peeling down those tight yoga pants, but as soon as we get inside her apartment she gives me a quick, promising kiss on the lips, and tells me she wants my opinion on her new outfit. She disappears into the bedroom, leaving me tingling pleasurably with anticipation; and returns a few moments later looking like a walking wet dream. Black lace lingerie, lace-topped stockings, garter belt, high heels; it might be a cliché, but it suits her hourglass figure perfectly. The panties cup her pussy so snugly I can see the hint of a cameltoe, and have a thong back that leaves her magnificent ass cheeks exposed.
Let’s find out what else makes her ass jiggle…
I soon reach the conclusion that those panties look even better around her thighs as I bend her forward over the couch and slot my tongue inside her creamy cunt. She’s so wet I don’t waste any more time with teasing, sucking up her sweetness, licking and rubbing until any hint of nervous inhibition has dissolved under my oral onslaught and she’s moaning and mashing her soaking pussy against my face. I adore feeling a girl shake apart as I eat her out, and I have a feeling I can guess what will push her over the edge.
I pull her panties right down so she can step out of them, then spread her legs — and her cheeks — wider. I was right, she goes wild as I paint her wetness up her ass crack with my tongue, lapping at the tight pucker until I feel her entire body shivering. I press deeper, opening her up little by little. Her legs are quivering, her booty quaking delightfully against my face, and as the tip of my tongue breaches that tight ring of muscle she has one of the fiercest assgasms I’ve ever given a girl, without any significant penetration.
Her legs are too wobbly to support her after that, so I lie back and pull her onto my face, sucking on her clit as I thrust a finger all the way into her ass. It feels almost impossibly tight at first, but a string of mini orgasms courtesy of my lashing tongue makes her loosen up, and then the way she squirms and squeals as I finger-fuck her ass lets me know I’m hitting the spot. But she really goes crazy when I turn her around so she’s sitting her ass on my face in a squat position and grind my knuckles over her clit as I lick her asshole as hard and deep as I can. I’m lucky she doesn’t suffocate me as she sags down on top of me, her body jerking convulsively… although it wouldn’t be a bad way to go, surrounded by twitching girl-flesh.
As first dates go, that was pretty intense. She’s too dazed (and, I suspect, inexperienced in the ways of lady lovin’) to get me off very effectively with her tongue and fingers, so I’m still horny as I go home and make what under the circumstances I can only describe as a “booty call” to my fuck buddy Tony.
I’m stripped down to my G-string, looking at my ass in the full-length mirror in my bedroom, as he answers the phone.
“Tony, does my ass jiggle?” I ask him, in lieu of saying hello. I bounce up and down a bit on the bed, watching for the ripple effect.
“No,” he replies, “your ass is a firm little peach, baby.”
“Not even when I go on the elliptical trainer at the gym?” I ask, vaguely disappointed.
“No. By the way, you know I’m at work, right? Can we not discuss your sexy ass and all the things I’d like to do to it right now, please.”
“Not even when you bend me over and fuck me from behind?”
“No, but it jiggles when I spank it, and you’d better believe you’re going to get a good hard spanking later!” he growls, hanging up.
So now I have my second challenge of the day: can I wait until Tony gets here to spank me until my cheeks are glowing and then fuck me hard enough to make them ripple like jello?
Or…Part ten: Turned on by a sexy plan
When I finished telling Angela’s story I knew I had to go to work, so I swung my legs around my makeup stool to enjoy the sensation of his erection between my breasts for a moment.
‘Does Sue know about you and Angela?’ he asked.
‘Oh yes. I don’t keep anything from her.’ I adjusted my bra so it was more comfortable.
‘Isn’t she jealous?’
‘No… and how could she be, given she is married to Ted?’
The humour was unintentional, but Liam nearly choked all the same. ‘Wait till I tell Toby that!’
‘What about Toby?’
‘You got a problem with me telling him? He is the only person other than Sue — and you — that has never run out on me. I always tell him everything, anyway, he is the only member of my family I have left.’
On day one, Sue and I had agreed that my house would be the one place where Toby could be himself, so I knew him pretty well. ‘No, of course not… anyway, he is such a nice guy.’
Liam looked unsure for a second. ‘Have you ever let him wear your clothes?’
I checked my mascara. There was no point being anything but honest. ‘Yes I have.’ I watched him in the mirror, because I had absolutely no idea what his reaction was going to be.
‘Sue usually lets him do it the moment Ted leaves for work. It felt kinda weird at first, but hey it’s no big deal, apart from when Ted comes home unexpectedly. Man, have we had some narrow escapes.’ He thought for a moment. ‘So, if you let him dress in your clothes, have you ever had… had…’
‘Had sex with him? No. Remember, he is only just eighteen.’ I gave him a stern look. ‘And before you ask, I don’t think Sue has, either.’
‘Just curious. I never know with Sue or you. If either of you did, it would be good for him. He once told me he couldn’t imagine any woman would ever want to have sex with him. Poor guy.’
Liam sounded so completely matter of fact about his brother’s cross dressing and the whole thing seemed so problematic that I let it drop. ‘Hey, I have an idea. Grab your clothes, I want you to come into work and meet someone.’
By the time I pulled the 911 up in my parking space, Liam had done everything except read the manual and take the vehicle to pieces to see how it worked. When we got out, he announced, ‘It’s awesome, but it’s not exactly the kind of car…’ his voice trailed away.
‘…that you expect a woman to own?’ I replied, my eyes glinting.
He recovered himself. ‘Sue says you only got the first one you bought because it was more powerful than Ted’s.’
That was true. I threw a smile over my shoulder. ‘Still remember his little darling face the first time he laid eyes on it.’
‘Why don’t you like him?’
‘Why does everybody not like him? If he wasn’t so certain that he was right and everyone else was wrong, he would be a damn sight easier to get along with.’ I had lost track of how much unsolicited advice Ted had given me over the years — printed out, it would have filled many boring volumes to bursting point.
‘Who am I going to meet?’
I pressed my key fob on the car park exit door. ‘Patience. You will find out soon enough.’
As we rode the elevator I adjusted his shirt. ‘You look great. I would fuck you right here if it wasn’t for the glass walls.’
Liam was still laughing when we reached my office. I threw my bag on a chair and spread my arms. ‘Make yourself at home. Want a coffee?’ When he nodded, I pressed a button on the intercom. ‘Two coffees, one for me and another black with sugar.’
I sank into my chair. This was going to be hugely entertaining, and I could only speculate at the outcome. But outcome there would be — I knew my PA inside out.
When Angela appeared with the coffee, she looked even more cheekily innocent than she normally did, assuming such a thing was possible. She gave Liam a dazzlingly shy smile of greeting, set down our coffees, and then walked very slowly around his chair, enjoying his puzzled appreciation. Men never seem to know how to respond to her, and he was no different — despite wearing a dress that was sensationally short, she managed to radiate her usual air of tomboyish virginity and I could tell he couldn’t cope with it at all. When she was standing right behind him, her coral lips formed the word, ‘Liam?’ and when I returned an imperceptible nod, she mimed sending a text. Then she was gone, leaving a waft of perfume to linger with her memory.
Liam was wide-eyed. ‘Who was that?’ he asked, jumping to his feet as soon as the door closed. He kept staring as if willpower alone could bring her back.
I studied my nails. ‘My PA. Now, drink your coffee, and be a love, I have some work to do.’
My phone went crazy with incoming texts, so many that in the end I excused myself and walked over to Angela’s office.
Her eyes were wide. ‘Is that really Liam?’
I sat on the edge of her desk. ‘Yep.’
She came up very close, spreading my legs so that she could stand between them. ‘I want to see you having sex with him.’
This was the Angela who had me in her palm. ‘You can’t,’ I whispered. ‘You just can’t!’
Her hand slipped inside my knickers and her fingertip went unerringly for its target. ‘You don’t understand. I really really want to see you have sex with him,’ she breathed, slipping two fingers inside as my pussy went to mush.
‘It isn’t possible,’ I hissed. ‘The situation is complicated enough as it is. Besides, you don’t even like having sex with men!’ On the last point I was confident, because in the time she had been with me I had established that Angela was almost exclusively lesbian in her tastes.
Angela didn’t let her eyes drop for a second as she began to work my clit with the ball of her thumb. ‘I don’t want to have sex with him,’ she replied, withdrawing her hand the precise moment before I would have come. ‘But I want to see you do it, and if you show me, then I will do anything you want me to do.’ This despite wearing an expression as if had she had just walked out of teaching Sunday school.
‘Do you want to be in the room with us, or what?’ Her finger was back at work, rubbing my clit through my panties now, and as the two layers of material slid against each other, the feeling began to build until I could hardly think straight. I was gripping the desk and had to force the words out.
‘All I want is to see him in here, filling you, while you squirm and sweat with lust. I know you won’t fail me. I want to see him sink into you until your pussy can take no more of him and then I want you to look at me when he comes.’ She increased her speed until I gasped and came, mostly for thinking of the scene she had just conjured up. Then I knelt while she stood over me and let me service her dripping slit. Her orgasms were quiet, controlled and ladylike, and as soon as they were done, she slipped two fingers deep inside before releasing her knickers. She held them out so I could them clean. ‘Another coffee?’ she asked, with a brilliant smile, for all the world as if she was seeking approval after finishing typing her first business letter.
In the end it turned out to be easier than I could possibly have hoped. After a brief struggle with my conscience, I rationalised that we used video in training all the time at work, so why not for teaching Liam about sex? When we got back home, I changed into a plunge bra and a dress I hadn’t worn in ages and worked the conversation around to the idea.
‘Like we do our own home porno flick?’ He sounded genuinely entertained by the idea. ‘If we do, I promise there won’t be any fast forward stuff.’
I took my courage in my hands and told him I wanted to film it with a proper video camera. To be honest, I could have told him that I wanted to video us having sex on a Swiss roll and he would probably have agreed — now that I had solved his problem he was desperate to make up for lost time.
The practical side of him soon took over. ‘But who is going to film it?’
With as much matter of factness as I could muster, I replied, ‘Angela. She does all our training videos,’ which was true, for I had spent thousands sending her on endless courses on editing and lighting. I just about managed to keep my voice level, because for all her expertise, it wasn’t quite the same as filming a blue movie.
I needn’t have worried. Liam blew out his lips at the thought, and shook his head, as though he couldn’t believe his luck. ‘Is there any chance that she…?’
‘Maybe, but she isn’t really much attracted to men, darling. Besides, I want you to myself for a while.’ I stroked his hair. ‘Angela says we are going to need two or three cameras, to get all the angles, so she will have her work cut out.’
Maybe Sue’s frank accounts of her sexual experiences had paved the way, but to this Liam said no more than, ‘Why not?’ Then, ‘You have already discussed this with her?’
I realised that I had very nearly let the cat out of the bag, so I leaned over, enjoying the thirst in his eyes as he drank in my cleavage. ‘You don’t fancy her more than me, I hope?’ I asked, pressing my upper arms against my boobs to make them pop.
He spluttered, ‘No, certainly not.’
‘But you do fancy her?’
‘Well, yeah, but who wouldn’t? Are you sure she is alright with this?’ He made it sound as if his major worry was that it wouldn’t go ahead. I felt a flood of relief, mixed with the sort of urgent sexual anticipation that only Angela could create in me.
‘Leave me to talk to her, okay? She does whatever I want.’ It was the only white lie of the evening.As they walked in the room he handed her an envelope. They were coming back from dinner at a posh place in the rooftop of one of the tallest buildings in London. She looked radiant in her little black dress and high heels. It was a celebration of sorts, and the night was still young.
He had flown in early in the afternoon and as soon as they had checked into the room they were fucking like bunnies. Going for dinner had been a necessary break to gather energy and fresh air for the encore session they were about to start. She looked in his mischievous eyes and asked:
“What’s in the envelope?”
He explained that he had written a bunch of positions on a set of cards and she could use them to choose the next position in which she wanted to be shagged. He was always having these unorthodox ideas, and now she was curious. She opened it up and found a familiar set of positions written down:
Missionary on the sofa
Monkey in the bathroom sink
Doggy standing by the mirror
Flat on the belly
…
One card caught her attention. She held it in her hand and looked up at his dark chocolatey eyes:
“What is upside down spoons?”
He answered that he would be happy to show her, as a naughty smile flashed across his face. She loved that look in his eyes, and felt her inner works jump with emotion. It made her feel so wanted, and gave her goosebumps. He helped her off with her coat, and then her shoes.
He had actually helped dress her up before dinner. He liked doing that, and she knew it was a strange kink but she liked it. As she had been lying naked in bed he had gathered the clothes she had brought for the occasion. He had gotten her garter belt on first, then her black stockings. He had then wrapped her up in her short black dress, no bra. And had finished by pulling her panties up.
She liked it when he did that to her. It was a special feeling of being cared for, even if it meant that she had to help with the stockings and correct her dress as she was getting her make up done in the bathroom.
As they were walking to the restaurant she felt some of their mixed juices dripping from her. During dinner it was a constant reminder of their hard workout that afternoon.
They started kissing. Soft in the lips. Her hands busy unbuttoning his shirt. His hands pulling up her dress. She was enjoying the feeling of his warm touch on her. And his hurry to get his hands under her clothes to caress her bare skin. He pulled the zipper of her dress down and helped her out of it, as she opened his shirt and got her hands on his chest.
They also liked undressing each other. It felt as if they were unwrapping their presents. She put her hands up to help him get her out of her dress. As he pushed her dress above her boobs, she started caressing him with soft touches of her fingernails.
She fell back onto the bed as he started kissing her right nipple. She loved the way he circled its tip with his tongue, making it wet and slurping on it until it felt as if her whole boob was made out of stone. As he moved to her other breast she could also feel how he was getting rid of his shirt and trousers.
She liked to lie in bed and have him do things to her. She had told him before how she enjoyed giving up control to him. After he got her second nipple wet and hard he started cruising her body with his mouth. Discovering every inch of her, kiss by kiss. As he got to the bottom of her rib cage she felt how he was sucking harder on her. He was marking the path through her using hickeys instead of breadcrumbs.
She was still lying in bed with her hands up and her dress covering her face. In a way as if she were blindfolded, except that she could free herself at any time. She felt him going down past her belly button and proceeding to her panties.
Her panties were wet, as in extra wet. He removed them and started exploring her vulva with his mouth. He found a little concentrate of their juices at her entrance. It almost felt like candy. He got as much as he could on the tip of his tongue and moved up to kiss her. He had to move the dress above her head to place the sweet dessert he had found on her mouth. She giggled when she realized what it was. As he was freeing her from her dress she asked him:
“So what about that upside down spoons you wrote about?”
He winked at her and moved her onto her side, as if he was going to spoon her from behind. Except that he placed his head at her feet and his knees on her back. He was indeed upside down from her. He opened up one of her legs as she reached for his shaft. It only took a few strokes to have him ready to go in. She placed the tip at her entrance and he moved up her hips to place himself in position.
The visuals were fantastic. She was so wet that he slid all the way in at the first push. He was kissing her left leg and holding her by her waist. She liked seeing how his cock was moving in and out of her. He told her with a wicked smile:
“ Remember how I told you I wanted to see how you masturbate? Well, now is the time. Show me how you touch yourself when we are not together and you are missing me!”
He got her hand on top of her clit and she started her little number, with two fingertips going up and down on top of it. He was moving slowly in and out, as she reached to his shaft to get some of their juices on her fingertips. Her fingers continued the dancing routine, except that the intimate atmosphere had now been replaced by the voyeurism of feeling his stare on her.
This felt so extremely hot to him. He could see in her face what she was experiencing. Every now and then she flashed a smile at him and looked in his eyes. She still had her stockings and garter belt on, and the view of her fantastic body from his vantage point was something out of this world. He could see in her expression how she was concentrating on her orgasm.
Her fingers were doing the final strokes and she knew she would be over the edge soon. The slow in and out dance was helping her build up. She opened her mouth to tell him:
“I am about to come…”
And with a few more caresses she arched her back and released the next batch of energy. He parked his cock all the way inside of her and could feel her shaking surrounding him. He was looking at her, as a spectator who has been given access to a very private show. A show built up of their love, of their want of each other, and from the build up of the days that they had not been together.
They agreed that these are the moments worth living for.Don’t speak to me with words
Talk with lips on skin
Scream with fingers on my back
Send your messageWhen it came to anal stuff she was a virgin. He had not pushed for it because it was not a kink that he was particularly looking for. However he knew from experience that there were girls who really, really liked it. So as they were cuddling in bed he brought the topic up. She was curious but since she did not know what to expect she was in no hurry to try it.
He was giving her oral pleasure, his tongue making pirouettes together with her clit, her labia being their dancefloor. She had her legs on his shoulders and was enjoying the slow and steady build up of energy down there. He had one hand by her butt crack, and the fingers of the other one were caressing the outside of her vulva.
He placed his finger at her entrance. She was relaxed and welcoming the visitor. She moved her hips to accommodate a better angle and his finger just slid inside of her. He felt her cushioned inside, which was extremely wet. He moved his index finger all the way in, but it was not enough. His middle finger came to the rescue and both made it as deep as they could get.
His tongue was concentrating on her clit as he looked up at her. She was observing him with a look of pleasure in her eyes. He paused and asked her:
“Do you want me to try through the back door?”
“If you want…” was her answer. After the long loving session her labia were so engorged that he knew she would probably be quite receptive to his finger. He moved his fingers out and placed the tip of the index one at her back entrance. He started playfully drilling in with a circular motion as she started moving her hips to accommodate this new sensation.
After a few strokes the finger made it all the way inside. He kept stroking as her moaning increased. He was focusing on her clit again and could feel that her emotions were about to overflow. His whole mouth was covering her pearl and he was sucking firmly. Suddenly the walls of her thighs came tumbling down with a roar.
He had brought some avocado oil-based organic lube for them to experiment with. She was now riding him on top. They had melted together again and did not know where one ended and the other started. During one of her motions away, his shaft came out of her. She flashed a mischievous look at him and grabbed his manhood with her hand, while the other one reached for the lube.
She got enough liquid on him and started stroking his cock. It was thick, but she really wanted to try to fit him inside through the back door. She guided the tip in place and started pushing down. It was a new feeling. His finger had just slid inside without much effort, but this thing was major work.
She placed her hands on his pelvis and closed her eyes as she started pushing down in little steps. Her nerves down there were in overdrive as she could feel a bit of a pang with every push. Slowly she made way for him; the deeper it got, the easier it became.
He was looking at her beautiful figure on top of him. Her face framed by her beautiful hair. Her breasts like two flowers in full bloom. His hands on her hips, trying to provide her with some support. She opened her eyes to look at him, and he could feel her internal emotion in her expression.
She moved down to place a kiss on his mouth, and told him:
“Here you go, my anal virginity, a present for you!”When your demure, beautiful wife suddenly proposes an orgy, do you:
a. ask further questions such as why? where? when? eh?
b. blurt out yes and fuck any negative consequences along with other people?
c. become instantly suspicious that this is a psychological mind game and refuse on the sacred grounds of monogamy?
d. suggest attempting reverse wheelbarrow first, or a quickie in a restaurant before the main course?
e. slowly back away from the alien in front of you?
Answer: none of the above. I laughed and said, ‘you’re taking the piss.’ But no piss was being taken. My wife had stolen the eyes of a nympho in heat. She’d even done research and produced colour coded post-it notes (ground rules, pros and cons etc) on sheets of A4.
‘Ah want to do something crazy,’ she said. ‘Don’t you?’
‘How dae you know about an orgy?’
‘A mate of mines was telling me she goes to one her mate arranges. They’re in right now.’
‘What mate is this?’
‘You don’t know her. Ah met her at the gym.’ Question overload. Do you… fuck it.
‘Why not?’ This was me trying not to play it cool like I had a fluffer and an extremely glamorous monthly STD check. ‘If it’s something you want to try, let’s do it. Are you alright with me, you know, doing things with other women?’
‘Are you alright with me doing things with women?’
‘Aye. Ah think ah can live with that.’
‘What about guys?’
‘Ah don’t think am ready to fuck a guy; orgy or no orgy.’
‘Ah meant me.’ Just make out you’re fine with it. Think of the greater good.
We arrive at the orgy headquarters in a leafy suburb far removed from our flat. My wife’s friend of a friend is obviously in the highest council tax band. The lucky bastard. I already fear this will be a scene from the class struggle as I treat this house like a hotel and steal bathroom supplies I might not need.
The place is massive inside and everyone is a bit too friendly, but the drinks are flowing. I suppose that’s vital given the purpose of the visit. The wine makes me feel more comfortable or less panic-stricken as I watch people slowly disappear upstairs past strange erotic art that must be taken down when the family comes to visit. My wife’s doppelgänger asks me if I like the look of certain women. This has to be some sort of elaborate ploy to question my commitment to her. I am unenthusiastic and use nice safe words.
The designated fuck spots in the bedrooms upstairs are filling up. I am now half-drunk and full-horny. These feelings are added to pensive, suspicious, scared and oddly melancholic. A couple befriend us with inane getting to know each other questions. It’s all a bit normal and unorgy like — not that I’m an expert when it comes to the etiquette. I respectfully pretend I need to piss and explore upstairs where doors are shamelessly open; I can see flesh writhing on flesh and people ignoring the searing pain in their knees. I have a nice, long look and take it all in.
I return to my wife who is eager to get going before she loses her nerve. Ourselves and a few other unsure orgy virgins are left dotted around the downstairs area. We are now at the stage where upstairs with the tits and cocks at every turn seems much more relaxing.
‘You okay?’ my wife asks.
‘Aye, in the pink.’
‘Let’s go upstairs,’ she says.
My cock is still flaccid, but I cajole it into a semi by looking in a few of the bedrooms. A gym-sculpted naked woman comes to a door and leads my wife in by the hand. They kiss and leave me looking like a sad animal in an unimpressive zoo. My wife finally remembers she came with a husband and pulls me in. There’s a woman being spit-roasted and a couple masturbating like an American general has launched a preemptive strike on Moscow. My cock responds and quickly assumes complete domination of my feeble brain.
The cock is rapidly rubbered up and in the mouth of another woman. My socks are still on and so are my trousers, but I have dispensed with the top half, which is folded neatly in the corner — my wife’s work after I dumped the shirt at my feet. Why didn’t I take the rest of it off when I had the chance? Now it seems disrespectful to take my cock out of this stranger’s mouth. What’s the protocol here? Never mind. Here comes a dick with nothing but glasses on to masturbate way too close to me for comfort. That’s my cue to get the rest of my clothes off. The socks are a bit of a struggle but they come off without me falling on my arse. Result. I come back to resume my blowjob, but the dick has moved in on my territory. Now I really am a spare prick. I get down on my knees behind my wife and lick her wet pussy.
A masturbating woman in the corner is definitely a turn-on. My eyes focus on her to avoid the cock and arse of the dick standing far too near to my wife. She catches me ogling and makes her way over to put her pussy in my face while I fuck my wife. As Thursday nights go, this in the top ten weirdest. Another guy enters the fray and seems enamoured with my wife, but my cock is staying inside her until he fucks off. I am the orgy spoilsport.
After some rearranging of bodies and embarrassed guffaws, I’m subjected to my wife sucking another man’s cock. I grin and bear it with my cock inside a beautiful, dark-skinned woman, who is a bit theatrical and fond of a verbal barrage. Her demands for me to go harder and deeper draw a few looks from the rest of the shaggers around the room. Eventually I have to get out of her to fly under the radar and not prematurely cum.
I continue wading through a raging sea of pointless, amazing pussy and trying not to cum. Inevitably, I cannot think about enough disgusting stuff to stop myself; it simply has to done. Realising you’ve attracted an audience to watch you cum is a bit disconcerting once the insane wears off. If you’re like me, your sexual hang ups may suddenly bulldoze through paper thin walls like a puritanical Kool-Aid Man.
I am in a rush to leave and not make eye contact with those still participating, especially the ones who want you to linger and salivate like a subjugated dog in front of a demented psychiatrist. No thank you. No more dinner for me. I am full. My fuck-crazy doppelgänger sticks around for another ten minutes, while I think about how to get my real wife back from the black lodge until I’m hard again. Her only disappointment is the absence of cuddling. There’s no cuddling after an orgy; at least not at this one. We will make up for the lack of that once we get home. Kung Fu death grip cuddles are coming.Eric and Tessa had been together for two years. It was a long-distance love affair. They treasured the time that they could spend together. They enjoyed the regular day to day things in life but when they got together things tended to go to the extreme. They drank more and they had a lot of sex. One extended weekend they had together, Eric came eleven times. It was amazing they could both walk after that one. Eric had come out of a loveless marriage and Tessa had been on her own for a few years when they met. They found in each other the highly sexual person they had each been hoping to find.
The sex had been fantastic from the start. It had been surprising and exhilarating to find the ideal lover. He had introduced her to anal sex and to her surprise she enjoyed it a lot with him. She had done it before, but not the way he did it. He enjoyed the lead up and playing as much as the actual penetration. Maybe he was a little preoccupied with the ass but it worked for them.
They enjoyed the fact that they could talk about anything; open sexual communication was something they both wanted. They could explore anything, first in words and if they were both comfortable with it, they moved to the physical. They had been talking about having a threesome for months. The problem wasn’t bringing someone else into it, it was the matter of who it would be. Tessa wasn’t interested in other women. She had always said that she really didn’t care who was licking her pussy but she had no real desire to lick pussy herself. So they would have to find the right guy to join them.
There wasn’t anyone in her circle of friends that she would be interested in. She always kept the idea at the back of her mind when she met different people, wondering if they would be suitable. Eric did the same. He tended to meet more people in his line of work than she did. He thought it would be incredibly hot to watch her with another man. He knew how much she loved giving head and she did it so well; watching her give a blowjob would be hot.
Over the months there were people that they discussed. It wasn’t a high priority but it was fun to add the conversation into the mix when they were having sex. They talked about what she would do to the guy. He told her he wanted to see her giving a blowjob while he was fucking her. That played nicely into her fantasy since she really loved cock. She wanted more than one cock but she wasn’t sure double penetration would be her thing. Having a cock driving into her while she had one in her mouth would be fun.
They planned for her to go to his place for a long weekend. He had been getting some work done on his garage and he had become friendly with the contractor. He considered him a possibility and decided to arrange it so that Dan, the contractor, would come by the house while Tessa was there that weekend. Eric had tried to feel out Dan for a reaction to the possibility of a threesome. He wasn’t specific in case it wasn’t something he’d be interested in. Dan had not committed to anything but he didn’t shut Eric down either.
Eric told Tessa about it on the Friday after she had arrived. She was excited. She had given Eric her criteria for a guy and this one seemed to meet it. They would find out the next afternoon if their fantasy would become reality. That night they had incredible sex anticipating and talking about what could happen. The next day, they went about their regular morning routine. Tessa gave Eric a blow job to wake him up and he couldn’t help but want to put his big, hard cock inside her wet pussy. She always got so wet when she gave a blow job. He fucked her gently at first but then he turned her around and got her up on her knees so he could fuck her hard from behind. She loved it like that but because he was so big sometimes it was like he was actually pushing her forward with the intensity of his thrusts. No matter, she took him in and loved it when he filled her with his cum.
Later in the afternoon Dan came by to discuss some details for the finishing touches to the garage. Tessa checked him out and approved. After they finished their business, Eric invited him in for a few beers and they decided to order a pizza. It all seemed very casual and natural. The drinks continued to flow and as they were sitting around the table the conversation started to turn sexual. Tessa asked Dan what he enjoyed in a woman. He was a breast man and loved nipples. If they stood out, they were that much better to him. He loved squeezing them. He would get hard the harder he squeezed them. Well this was sounding very good to Tessa. She had great tits and her nipples were definitely outstanding and very sensitive!
Maybe it was the drinks but after another beer she grew bold and decided to get up from the table and walk over to Dan. They thought she was just going to the kitchen, but she stood beside him and pulled down her shirt and bra to show him her nipple. Eric smiled and although Dan was a little surprised he hardly skipped a beat as he just reached up and squeezed.
“Those are certainly great nipples,” he said as he squeezed her hard.
She let out a little moan. She had already discussed how she got wet instantly when her nipples were squeezed so both Eric and Dan knew what would happen to her. Dan quickly unleashed the other one and he was squeezing both of them. Well they knew Tessa was getting wet but they also knew that Dan would be getting hard. It wasn’t lost on Eric and sure enough his big cock started to rise. Dan pulled Tessa to him and took her breast into his mouth and bit down on the nipple. Ohhhh, that felt good.
Eric was getting really hard watching this initial contact. He wondered where things would go. Dan looked over to Eric to make sure he was okay with what was going on. Eric gave him a nod, it was fine, maybe even better than they could’ve anticipated. Neither Eric nor Tessa had figured out how things would start. This was working well.
Dan reached for Tessa’s crotch and felt the growing heat. That was all he needed to get his erection even harder. He unbuttoned her jeans and undid the zipper and quickly slid a finger into that wet pussy. Heaven. She was so wet already. She wasn’t kidding when she had said there was a direct connection from her nipples to her pussy.
Dan finger fucked her and she held his head hard to her breast, all while he was still biting her nipple. Eric had to unleash his beast. He undid his pants and brought out that beautiful cock and moved back from the table so that he could stroke it as he watched them. Tessa opened her eyes and locked them with Eric’s as she smiled at him. They hadn’t talked about exactly what would happen, they figured it would just happen, and it sure was. Eric smiled back at her, he was enjoying the show knowing that Dan was getting her so wet.
Dan knew what he could do to a woman, he had a trick up his sleeve and wanted to show them both. He pulled her jeans down further and started moving his fingers on her G-spot. That felt good but Tessa wasn’t ready for what happened next. Within two minutes of him starting, Tessa’s pleasure was building in intensity and her knees were getting weak. All of a sudden she was squirting. Dan quickly took her pants down further while still massaging her. He loved seeing a woman squirt and he knew he would get her going quickly.
Tessa had squirted before but it was usually when Eric had her propped up on the bathroom vanity. She always figured it was the position of his cock hitting her just right. She always felt spent in the best way after she squirted. This was the same feeling. After what seemed like a long time, but probably wasn’t, she needed to sit down. Dan had a big smile on his face and Eric was just surprised. He wanted to know how to do that.
“I can’t believe you got me going so quickly! I’ve never squirted standing up.”
“It’s all in the finger play.”
There was a big chair close by and Tessa went over and collapsed into it. What a feeling that had been. She had a big smile on her face. Eric came over to her and kissed her.
“What did you think of that? You enjoyed it?”
“Oh yes, how could I not?” she replied.
“You know what that did to me? It was fun watching, I want to try that on you but first I need to do something with this.” He was stroking his cock.
She smiled and reached out for his cock. It really was a great cock, to look at and to suck and to fuck. She wanted him inside her and she knew he would oblige. She spread her legs for him to get a feel of her. She was wet and he knelt to have a little taste and then stood up, picked her up and turned her around. He took her by the hips and slowly guided his hard cock into her pussy. He loved looking at her ass as he drove his hard shaft into her. After a couple of slow moves, he couldn’t help himself, he started going faster, he knew she loved it. They had a fantastic sex life, they were in sync and their sex drives were at the same level, very high.
Dan was watching from his chair at the table, it was a good view. He watched as Eric’s cock went in and out and enjoyed watching Tessa’s tits sway back and forth, she really did have great tits. He sat and stroked his cock, this was a good show.
Eric was loving the feel of Tessa’s wetness enveloping his cock. She had a nice tight pussy. He slid in and out easily. At one point he looked over at Dan and took a moment to watch him stroking his cock. The sight of Dan stroking his cock while watching them seemed to get his cock even harder. He slowed it down just a little. Dan gave an inquisitive look to Eric and Eric motioned him over. Dan cupped Tessa’s breast and rubbed her shoulder. She let out a purr and rolled her shoulders. The feeling of Dan’s hands on her and Eric’s cock in her was mind-blowing. It was about to get better.
Dan reached down to rub Tessa’s clit as Eric pumped into her. He also gave a feel to Eric’s balls as he moved in and out. It was such an electric sexual atmosphere, everything felt right. That touch added to Eric’s pleasure.
It wasn’t long before Tessa took Dan’s cock in her mouth and started to really go at him. This was the ultimate. She didn’t really want double penetration, but she sure wanted cock! She was very much in the moment, having cocks coming at her from two directions was fantastic. She devoured Dan’s cock. Eric’s excitement was building, watching Tessa so enthusiastically suck cock was really turning him on and making him so hard.
Dan was loving it. Watching Tessa suck his cock, watching Eric fuck her, it was a great show! They were all enjoying the moment, it just kept going and they were all being satisfied, what more could they ask for?
The visuals were getting the best of Eric, he could feel his orgasm building and building. Tessa sucking cock, the way her back arched and the way she was giving her ass to him. He grabbed her hips tighter and with his signature double pump and then a slight break in the action, he emptied himself into her and let out a wonderfully expressive groan and kept tight inside her.
Tessa broke away from Dan’s cock and enjoyed the sensation of Eric filling her, giving her all she wanted. Dan took a step back and leaned on the chair. He certainly hadn’t realized what was going to transpire when he had come by that afternoon. He couldn’t have been happier with the change of plans for the night.
Tessa moved over to the couch to spread out and relax. Eric came over to sit beside her while Dan went to the kitchen to get more beer, they could all use the refreshments. He sat down on the loveseat and smiled at all the visions that were going through his mind. He knew this wasn’t the end, it was only the beginning.
Soon the conversation turned back to squirting and Dan’s technique. Eric was really interested in how he managed to get a woman to go so quickly. Dan was showing him, he needed to move his fingers like he was motioning for someone to come over but do that with his middle finger as the main motion and his index following. Eric wanted to try it out.
“What do you think, baby, are you ready to go again?”
“I’m not sure, but I wouldn’t want to interfere with your education,” she said with a smile.
She stayed in place, laying on the couch, and spread her legs for them. Somehow this didn’t feel strange. She had only met Dan a couple of hours before but here she was, being his canvas and letting him play with her body. He couldn’t help but reach out for her nipples. They were like bullets and he couldn’t resist them. It didn’t hurt that the reaction of her pussy was almost simultaneous, getting those juices flowing. Eric put his fingers inside her but she wanted more than to just give them what they wanted. She asked that he put his tongue inside her and play with her clit. Eric did as requested and Dan looked on with a big smile on his face and his fingers still pinching her nipples. Now this was something new for her, having her man licking her pussy but having Dan there watching. Yes, she liked it and she locked eyes with Dan, giving him a wicked smile that got his cock hard.
She reached out and grabbed the waistband of his jeans and pulled him closer and started undoing his pants. She wanted cock. Eric was expertly playing with her pussy, she wanted a cock in her mouth. Dan happily obliged. He was already hard as she wrestled his cock out of his pants but as soon as she started playing with him he got bigger in her mouth. He wasn’t as big as Eric but he was still a good size. She took him all in and then started playing with his head. She knew many men liked when she rubbed her tongue at the base of the head on the ridge where the shaft met the head. She was getting him going, there was no doubt about that and Eric raised his head and smiled at her. He knew she enjoyed cock. She was full of sensation, Eric’s expert tongue on her clit and licking her pussy, Dan pinching her nipples and his cock in her mouth. She devoured the cock just as Eric was devouring her pussy. Dan put his head back and enjoyed it all.
With all this going on it didn’t take long for her orgasm to build and Eric knew it was coming. He slipped his fingers into her and got a good pace going. Soon she was holding his head to her pussy while she ground her hips into his face and with her other hand she held onto Dan’s cock. It was building and building and then with one last suck on her clit Eric took her over the edge and she released Dan’s cock and threw her head back and screamed. That was intense!
She had played with two men before but it hadn’t been like this. This time it was all about her. They wanted to please her, her orgasm was the goal and she got it. She lay back and smiled and curled up. Eric licked his fingers and wiped his face. He didn’t notice Dan watching him. Dan wanted some of that but realized it wasn’t the time yet. He hoped he’d have his turn tasting that pussy.
Eric got up to have a smoke on the deck. Tessa was still naked, curled up on the couch, practically purring like a kitten. Dan sat down next to her and started caressing her ass. She had a great body and the way she had reacted to them was thrilling. He kept rubbing her ass and then he couldn’t help himself, he slid two fingers into her. But he didn’t want to make her cum, he just wanted to touch her, to feel her wetness. He really wanted to taste her. He was slow and soft. She enjoyed it and so did he. He took his fingers out and she turned her head just as he put them into his mouth. She smiled. He slid them back in and was gentle. He just wanted to feel her and massage her. She didn’t mind at all, it felt quite nice to have that compared to the rush of the orgasm.
She was still so wet and he wanted to taste her but he knew she wasn’t quite ready for another orgasm. Her pussy had already had a lot of action and it was pretty intense. Eric came back and was a little surprised to see Dan with his fingers inside Tessa. He didn’t really think he could say much considering a few minutes before he had been watching her suck Dan’s cock. It just seemed like an intimate moment and he wasn’t sure how he felt about that.
Eric sat down in the side chair and watched as Dan continued to stroke and caress Tessa’s pussy. Soon he found himself getting hard again and he started rubbing his cock. Tessa had her eyes closed, she was just enjoying the sensations but then she opened them and noticed Eric getting his cock hard again.
“Don’t even think about it, I need a little break and this feels nice.”
“I’m just enjoying the visual,” he said as he continued to rub his cock through his jeans.
Dan was enjoying the dynamic. He could tell Tessa was relishing it all but he picked up on Eric’s hesitancy; he didn’t care. He figured he’d been invited into this play so he was going to enjoy himself too. Dan spread Tessa lips with one hand and with his other hand he slid a finger in. Again, he wasn’t going fast, just slow and steady, but she started moving her hips with his rhythm. She was getting into it. Eric pulled out his cock and started stroking it. A bit of pre-cum came out and he took it with his finger and tasted it.
Tessa was watching him. “Hey, that’s not fair. You should be sharing with me.” She always had a hard time resisting his cock when she saw it. Eric knew this. Dan continued to stroke her but smiled. Tessa reached out her hand toward Eric, wanting that cock. Eric got up and continued stroking his cock. He took the few steps toward her but he didn’t give her his cock right away. He stood just out of her reach and increased the speed of his stroke. Dan noticed that she started to get wetter so he increased his speed just a little bit. What he really wanted was to throw her onto her back and sink his face into her wet cunt but it wasn’t the time for that. She’d just had that. He figured he was using extra special restraint but she had such a pliable body and was so open to experiencing sensations that he was truly enjoying the sensation of his fingers inside her, what the whole experience was giving to her.
Eric continued his strokes for a few more seconds but he didn’t want to deny Tessa what she wanted, and he loved the feel of his cock in her mouth. He stepped to her and she opened her mouth for him. He went in as far as she could take. He kept a similar pace as Dan was doing with her pussy, slow and easy and very enjoyable. The point of playing wasn’t always to climax, sometimes it was great to feel the sensations and enjoy it for what it was. The whole night was the experience. To have a night filled with sexual experiences, a sexual feel to everything that happened. Sex was on the agenda and they wanted it, but sex can take on many forms.
She loved the feel of Eric’s cock in her mouth. He was bigger than most and she had a gag reflex so there was no way that she could take all of him in but that was ok, he never complained, how could he when the way she played with him gave him such pleasure. She was a master of the blowjob. The way she played with her tongue, how she changed pace and position, but it was her enjoyment and desire to give that was the best part of the blowjob. Sure, any guy likes getting a blowjob but when a woman gives with such enthusiasm, it’s not a job.
Tessa always made sure that she was in the moment and she got hot and very wet when she gave a blowjob. Knowing that what she was giving was making her man feel so good, that made her happy and want to give more. That’s why it was so good when she got feedback from her man. Moans and groans, motions, participation went a long way for her. Right now she had the attention of both men and she couldn’t be happier. It was all slow and easy and relaxed and full of sensation.
After a while, Eric pulled out and went out for another smoke. Dan licked his fingers and just relaxed. Tessa laid there and melted into the couch. She was enjoying the total relaxation that sexual satisfaction can bring. They turned the music up and just hung out for a bit.
Eric came back and they sat around just talking about regular stuff. If anyone walked in they would think there were just a group of friends hanging out for the night. But that wasn’t going to last. This was just an intermission.
Eric asked if anyone else wanted a beer and got up to go to the kitchen. Tessa followed Eric, she wanted to make sure he was ok with everything that was going on. He reached into the fridge and as he turned around she was there. She kissed him deeply and he responded. He had no problem with what had been going on. It wasn’t the norm, but he was enjoying it and he knew she was too, that was very important. He took her in his arms and really kissed her.
They held the embrace and enjoyed the moment.
Dan was wondering why his beer was taking so long so he came into the kitchen to get it himself. He saw Eric and Tessa together and took a quick step back but stopped and watched. Neither of them had heard him come around the corner but it was interesting to watch them kiss. They devoured each other in a very intimate way. That was just between them.
“What’s a guy gotta do to get a beer around here?”
They slowly parted. Dan wasn’t an interruption for Tessa, he was an addition. She looked from Eric to Dan and then down to their pants. She took hold of their waistbands and pulled them both towards her. She knelt and smiled up at them as she started undoing buttons. They helped getting themselves free and ready for her. She took one look up at them and then she looked at both cocks in front of her and dove in. Two really good cocks ready for her, a very good thing.
She took Eric first and got him wet and then did the same to Dan. She worked them both, she hoped she could get one to cum and the other would follow, she’d take as much as she could. She had never given two blowjobs at once. She’d watched porn of course but it was a little different to have both presented to her. They both started to grow harder, they were enjoying this and so was she. Tessa went a little faster, she switched between them, she always had her hands on them. She was trying to pump Dan while she went down and sucked on Eric’s balls, she knew how he enjoyed when she mixed things up. He threw back his head and let out a low, loud moan. Dan seemed to get harder with that.
Well she couldn’t leave Dan out of the mix, she went back to him and took his balls in her mouth. Yes, Dan understood why Eric moaned. This was feeling fantastic and knowing that she was excited and enthused to have both, it made it so much better. She kept going on them, switching up, and then at one point she took both hard cocks into her mouth. She was surprised she could get her mouth wide enough but wow, what a feeling to get them both.
Cock, all cock. She was excited and very much in the moment. She felt in control. Sure, they were the ones with the hard cocks but she was orchestrating it and controlling it. That was a heady feeling. She went with it and made sure they were enjoying the sensations. She knew she was. This night had been more than she could’ve imagined.
She noticed that Eric was grinding just a little bit faster. Her moans grew louder as she felt him responding to her. She knew it added to the experience for Eric to have Dan there, to be standing next to each other, two hard cocks. Guys were usually competitive but this wasn’t like that, they were all enjoying the pure, raw sexuality that had taken over for them all.
She wanted to take him down but she didn’t want to leave Dan out. This was her chance to have both men cumming on her tits, she’d take what she could in her mouth but she wanted them all over her tits too. After all it wasn’t all about them, she was going to get what she wanted. Rubbing warm cum all over her chest was so decadent to her, she loved the feeling.
Tessa had Eric in her mouth and pumping Dan hard with her hand. Who would be the first to cum? She was pretty sure they were both getting close. She switched over to Dan for a moment and Eric took his own cock in his hand. She kept her eye on Eric so she would know when to open for him. It didn’t take long, he started to moan and since Dan wasn’t cumming yet, she came off him and opened her mouth wide for Eric to shoot right into her.
The sight of Eric cumming and Tessa’s hand on his cock was all it took for Dan to follow suit. He took his cock back and gave the last few pumps as he watched Eric’s white cum shoot right into Tessa’s mouth. He aimed for her chest but Tessa saw what was happening and quickly turned to capture some of him in her mouth as well. Eric continued to cum on her chest. When her mouth was full she lifted her chin and Dan finished off on her chest.
She looked up at them and opened her mouth to show them both and sure enough some cum came out to trickle down her chin. She smiled and drank them down as she started to smear them together across her tits. The warmth of them made her nipples hard. It couldn’t have turned out better.
She licked the last drop from her lip and sat back on her heels. Oh yes, this was a fucking memorable night. The feel of their hands on and in her body, her breasts, her skin and her clit, to be finished off by their hot cum spread over her. A night that would not be forgotten.She had been out with Julia, her assistant, at Chin Chin on Sunset to celebrate a new account for her dance consulting company. As they were eating, they couldn’t help noticing a group of professional athletes out for a night out at a table nearby. Christina didn’t know anything about sports teams, so she probably had no idea it was some famous faces from the sports world sitting there eating fancy Chinese food. But she noticed them.
Andre (obviously I’ve changed all their names!) the good looking football player seated there serving himself up barbecue pork, didn’t play for a Los Angeles team. He played for a team back east, but like many professional athletes he came to LA for various professional and social activities, shooting commercials, meeting with agents, and so on. At the table with him was a pro baseball player named LaShawn, and a basketball player named Lester. At one point Andre made eye contact across the way with Christina. She has a fleck of purple in her irises, and sometimes it catches the light in a peculiar way that makes a violet colored spark across the room. That’s probably what Andre saw. She smiled at him, and he smiled back. That was the end of it.
But later when she excused herself to go to the bathroom, Andre’s baseball player friend, LaShawn, came over to Julia and told her, “Pardon the intrusion, but my friend over there, Andre, he noticed your friend and he was wondering if you could give her his number.” He handed Julia a card with Andre’s number on it.
“She’s married,” said Julia, without missing a beat, and handed him back the card. “But thank you anyhow.”
The baseball player bowed politely and excused himself, taking the card back to his friend and no doubt razzing him a bit about striking out like that. When Christina came back from the bathroom, Julia told her what had happened and they shared a laugh. Julia, of course, knew nothing about my wife’s hobby, and found the whole thing amusing but not surprising, as people had come up to her many, many times before to ask about Christina.
On their way out, Julia didn’t see my wife very casually and sneakily pass by the professional athletes’ table and drop her card in front of Andre. He looked up at her in great surprise. She winked and carried on to catch up to Julia.
Andre called and texted Christina a bunch of times that week, but she was very busy and couldn’t arrange a time to meet him. She wasn’t even sure she wanted to meet him. Finally, she came to me and told me this football player was texting her.
I am not a big sports guy. I don’t know anything about pro sports, but I had at least heard this guy’s name. And it was kind of intimidating. I felt something very hard in my chest. A famous guy was texting my Christina. This was a new feeling.
“Wow,” I said. “He’s pretty famous I think.”
Needless to say, that was a night of googling. I boned up on Andre and learned all about his career and his rushing statistics and all kinds of stuff. He was a super successful athlete.
“He’s also married,” I told her.
“Yeah,” she said. “So am I.”
“I wonder what he was doing running around LA handing out his business card to chicks like you.”
“Yeah, I wonder,” she said. “Maybe he likes older women.”
My wife pretends to be in her late thirties. Who knows how old any woman is? She keeps in great shape. You would never know she has teenaged kids. She looks maybe in her early thirties. But still, that is a bit of a stretch for a professional football player in his twenties. He was definitely age inappropriate for her. Weren’t there enough 22-year-old cheerleaders for him to bang? Why did he have to pick on my wife?
“What’s wrong?” my wife asked the next morning during breakfast. “You look sick.”
“I am sick,” I complained. “I am worried sick about this football player. He’s…he’s…too much.”
“Too much what,” she said.
“He’s too famous. He’s too good looking. He’s too in shape. He’s too fucking perfect.”
“OK honey,” she said sweetly. “If you want, I’ll block his number. You know we haven’t even spoken. He just sent me a few texts. I’ll cut it off. No problem.”
I felt better then. But right away I had seller’s remorse.
What if this guy really was the fuck of the century and I was depriving my lovely Christina of it?
That day at work I locked myself in the men’s room stall and I couldn’t help beating off to the thought of this football player doing my wife. I wouldn’t be able to watch, no way. A famous guy like that does not want to be watched having sex. I wouldn’t even be allowed to wait downstairs in his hotel. I would have to wait outside, in the car. While they went upstairs. He was probably saying in the Peninsula or one of those other super nice Beverly Hills places. I would be circling the block, there’s never parking on Rodeo. Christina would be upstairs with this running back. He would be running his hands down her naked back. He would turn her over and run his big fingers down her shoulders, and onto her breasts. He would be stroking her nipples. He would be getting an erection. He would pull his erection out of his briefs. It would be huge. A big black cock.
“Mmmm,” Christina would say. “Yummy.”
Then she would suck it.
And so it went. I was so into it I went through the whole routine about four times that day, my wife being satisfied by the largeness of Andre. By the beautiful body of this star athlete, his rippling muscles, his handsome, devilish smiling face. He would be talking to her as he was running his fingers across her naked body.
“I wanted to tap that the moment I saw you across the room at that Chinese place,” he was saying.
“Why?” she would sigh, fishing like she does, for the praise and adulation.
“You got the prettiest eyes I ever saw. They caught me in their grip. I couldn’t get out of their grip, you know. That’s what I do for a living, I evade tackles. I couldn’t evade the tackle of your eyes.”
“I tackled you,” she sighs.
“You took me to the ground, girl,” he said. “You slammed me. And now look, this black motherfucker is all yours. I’m gonna do anything for you. Anything you want.”
“Will you film a promo for this sports club I’m promoting.”
“Oh hell yes,” he said. “You just send the shit over to my agent. I’ll sign anything. Just let me fuck you baby.”
Now I’m not one of these guys in the cuck community who is obsessed with watching my wife get the BBC, the big black cock. I don’t care what color it is, I just want it to be big. And so does Christina. I am also made slightly uncomfortable by the racial component to a lot of the cuck porn. It seems to be perpetuating the racist stereotype of the African American male as wild sex beast. But that’s not what Andre was. He was a charismatic, well-loved person. And I was so happy, in my fantasy, that he was making my wife so horny. She didn’t know she was the kind of person a famous football star would like to fuck. This must be kind of blowing her mind. As it was blowing mine.
That night at dinner I mentioned to Christina, “Listen, I had a think about it. If you want to call Andre I have no objection.”
“Aww….” said Christina. “Are you sure? I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.”
“I’m sure,” I said. She gave me a big wet kiss.
It was about three days later that they got together. It wasn’t a hotel. Turns out that Andre had a huge mansion in Beverly Hills, one of those things they call a Mega Mansion. But his family didn’t live there. They lived in in the north east. When Andre came out to LA, though, he stayed in this enormous place.
“It was like a castle,” Christina told me, when she got home that night after her date with him. “It was like twenty rooms. And he was all alone there.”
“Did you have fun?” I asked her.
“Sure,” she said. “But…gotta say. He wasn’t that big.”
“Oh no?”
“He was about your size,” she said. “Not small, but…”
“So you didn’t fuck him?”
“What would be the point?”
See, all African American males are not huge. That’s a cuckold community myth. My wife has had two black guys. One was huge. The other was not. Go figure.
“We fooled around a little and then I said goodbye,” she said. “I’m gonna go up and take a shower.”
I found out later that night, after a lot of digging, how it all went down.
She drove over to his house. He had some champagne all set out. She took some sips of the champagne. She asked about his family, his wife and so on. He didn’t want to talk about it. He asked about her family. She told him about me, about my strange proclivities.
“He should be here watching,” he said, when he heard. “Why the hell don’t you call him?”
He was into it!
“No,” said Christina. “I want you all to myself.”
“You got me baby. You got me all to yourself.”
He went in for the kiss and they made out for a long time. Then he took her by the hand over to the master bedroom. It was an enormous oval shaped bed. There were fish tanks and an exotic lighting set up so the room was glowing with red and yellow. And then, she saw smoke. He had some kind of smoke machine.
She laughed.
There was some intense loud music then, just in time as Andre stripped off his clothes and revealed his boner. Nice average sized boner. My wife went over and sucked it. He wanted to cum in her face but she moved her head away and he came onto the fish tank next to the bed.
“Oh man, I came on Snoop’s tank.”
That was what he called his fish. Snoop Dog. Cause it was some kind of Dog Fish, I guess.
“Now lie back girl, he told her. “I want to slide those panties off you and make you as happy as you just made me.”
He slid off her panties and ate her. By the time she came, he was hard again.
“You ready for the real deal?” he asked her. “You ready to fuck Andre?”
“Nah,” said Christine. “I’m good.”
“For real, baby?” he said, hurt. “I can taste you down there, you’re ripe and ready for it.”
“Let’s save something for next time,” she said, with some authority. He got the message.
“Alright, alright,” he said. “That’s cool. At least I don’t have to lie to my wife. I didn’t fuck nobody.”
“Neither did I,” she said, getting her clothes back on.
“But won’t your husband be disappointed?” he said. “Didn’t he want you to fuck me?”
“Whose life is it?” she asked him. “His or mine?”
“Oh baby, you are one powerful female,” he said, admiring the steely strength of my Christina.
After she told me that final detail, in bed that night, she said, “My darling, you know yours is the only average sized cock that I’m ever gonna let into this pussy.”
She pulled me into her, and I fucked her. My wife! So loyal, I almost wanted to cry.
So Andre ended up filming a promo for Christina’s company, just like he promised. Then he texted her almost every time he came out to LA. Finally, his team came to play here. I knew she’d be hearing from him. She was polite, and told him no. He offered us bench seats, box seats, all kinds of shit.
“I want to meet that crazy husband of yours,” he said. “He sounds like a real freak. Tell him I’ll fuck you in front of him.”
“No, Andre,” she said. “We’re too busy. Maybe next time.”
“Come on, I got this game coming up, help me out here,” he begged.
“I am helping you out, Andre,” she said. “You gotta stay hungry!”
“Oh baby, I’m more than hungry. I’m desperate. I’m gonna die.”
Christina is a little cruel, but you knew that. She could easily have made a sharp cut and blocked Andre’s number. But the idea of this superstar athlete drooling for her, it made her so horny.
“You’ll be fine,” she said on the phone. He must have been really whining and pretending he was dying because she wouldn’t let him fuck her. My wife was grinning from ear to ear.
“Bye Andre,” she said.
Then she hung up on him.
She looked over at me and smiled. I knew what she was saying with that smile. “I got his power, all his power, and I got it by not fucking him. Every time it’s different. Sometimes you get their power by fucking them. But sometimes you get it by not fucking them.”
We watched the game that weekend. Andre got the ball and blasted through about six guys to score a touchdown in the last second. Winning the game.
“See,” my wife said to me. “See what you can do when you stay hungry!”
My wife wants me to stay hungry. She wants me to stay crazy for her, to always long for her, to be hungry to improve myself and to one day, maybe, become her bull. I’m not there yet. But the night she dated Andre and I fucked her instead of that famous football player, for one night at least, I felt like quite the stud.They slip into the pool as quietly as possible. There is a sign at the pool’s edge that reads ‘No swimming after 20:00’ and it is now almost midnight.
“What’s the worst that can happen?” she whispers to her husband, giggling.
Someone would come and tell them to get out, and please not to do it again. The islanders are such friendly people, they would definitely say “please,” and that would be the end of it. It is worth the risk.
The water feels wonderful on her skin, washing away the sweat from a day of walking and shopping around the tropical beach resort. She feels so lucky to have a man that doesn’t mind a whole day of shopping with her. They both love it here, the comforting heat almost a silent promise that they would never be cold again. They both hate getting cold, it means too many clothes.
She is still very excited after watching the boxing. She hadn’t expected to enjoy it so much, and at first had refused to go. A lovely meal and a few beers before the event, and she found herself watching, fascinated and silently hoping that one of the fighters would get hammered to the floor. If truth be told, she was quite turned on by the whole business and she had felt the warmth build between her legs as the fight progressed. Now it was positively throbbing for his touch.
The warm water clears her head a bit, the combination of beer and the excitement perfectly complementing each other, totally dissolving any inhibitions she might normally feel.
She turns around and swims towards him. Looking briefly over her shoulder to see if anyone is about, before leaning in and kissing him full on the lips. She kisses him hard, feeling a flutter in her stomach as she feels his already semi hard cock pressing against her stomach. He clearly has been thinking the same thing as her.
She lifts her legs, wrapping them around his waist, and starts gently grinding against him, teasing him, curious as to how far he will go. Slightly uncomfortable at first, he suddenly escapes from the fabric prison and expands to full hardness inside his pants. Her left hand snakes down between their stomachs and into his pants, gasping at the silky feeling of his rock hard cock. He has never felt so hard before, and she strokes him gently, feeling him groan as she kisses him deeply.
His hands now slip around her waist and slide into the back of her bikini bottom, squeezing her ass before slowly pulling her cheeks apart. She loves it when he does that, feeling the wrinkled skin of her anus being stretched and the lips of her pussy being gently parted. She moans her approval as he continues to pull her ass cheeks first up, then out and back down again. Repeating this pattern over and over again, keeping the tension on her anus and pussy constant.
Still stroking him with her left hand, she now reaches around with her other hand and plunges it into the back of his pants, his hands on her ass keeping her up. All this action and stimulation to her own ass has made her desperate for his. Her middle finger moves to the crease between his butt cheeks, extending it down the slit as she breaks their kiss and drops her body a bit for more reach. Her finger probes eagerly, deeper and deeper into the back of his pants searching for his opening. Finding it, she starts gently massaging him, hearing him groan loudly in pleasure.
She looks behind her nervously to see if anyone is looking. His excitement is becoming hard to contain and the fear of being caught somehow heightens their pleasure. As she peers over her shoulder in the direction of the hotel reception, he removes his left hand from her ass and reaches up for her bikini top, exposing her right breast to the evening air. He opens his mouth wide, engulfing her nipple and as much of her breast as he can. He tongues her nipple ferociously, lost in the ecstasy of his cock and ass being rubbed at the same time.
She moans softly, feeling his right hand now heading in the same direction. He finds her anus in no time and starts to imitate her movements. They stimulate each other’s holes in unison, fingers moving in circles around the openings, stretching the puckered skin as they both groan in pleasure. Every so often they dip a finger into the opening before returning to the sensitive wrinkled skin, smoothing it out with their fingertips.
She turns back to him now, throwing her head back and enjoying the sensation of her nipple and ass being stimulated. She starts craving some attention to her superheated pussy and sighs when, as if he could read her mind, his left hand slides in the front of her bikini panties and starts gently rubbing her. The feeling of being stimulated in three places now is too much for her and she groans loudly as he thrusts two fingers inside her.
Her head comes back up and she whispers into his ear.
“Baby…I need your cock inside me now.” She grinds her hips into his oncoming fingers.
Up until that moment, he had been thinking that they were just fooling around like two horny teenagers. That eventually one of them would break off their steamy embrace, allowing their nerves to get the better of them. He realises now that she wants him to fuck her, right here in the open. This isn’t really something he has ever fantasised about, but now that it is about to happen he finds himself incredibly turned on and excited by the thought. He almost expects the sudden rush of excitement to trigger his orgasm in her hand, but the cool water keeps him subdued.
He removes his hands from her bikini panties, grabbing her by the hips and twisting her around aggressively. She loves the forceful way that he is handling her now, anticipating the hard pounding that is about to commence. She loves it when he takes her from behind, letting herself go while her husband transforms into a wild beast.
She reaches down and pulls the fabric of her bikini to the side as her other hand reaches behind her for his cock. He lifts her hips effortlessly, positioning her ass at the perfect height while she guides him into her. She breathes in deeply as she feels him sliding effortlessly into her in one smooth stroke, his thick shaft opening her up. She hears him grunt behind her as he buries himself to the hilt.
She feels a bit awkward in this position, as though she wants to fall forward face first into the water. They have never made love in a pool before, and she has to use every core muscle she possesses to keep herself from toppling over. Quickly she wraps her feet around his calves to try and steady herself as she feels his grip tighten around her hips, starting to plunge himself in and out of her.
Their hips are only just submerged under the water and so they manage to keep the splashing and noise to a minimum. He starts ramming into her harder and harder and she can hear his groaning becoming louder and louder. She’s torn between wanting him to cum inside her immediately, to escape this adventure undiscovered, and wishing he could fuck her like this until the end of time.
The beer and cold water keeps his orgasm at bay, but soon he feels himself straining to keep up the pace as he rams his hips into her from behind. She’s paddling with her hands ferociously now, in an attempt to keep up with his rapid pace and to keep him buried deeply inside her. She’s panting louder and louder with every thrust and slowly in the depths of his loins, he starts to feel the familiar sensation of his oncoming orgasm. He can slow his thrusts down now to prolong the sex, or he can continue to thrust vigorously, giving himself at most another few seconds inside her. His lust and desire to cum overwhelms him, and he thrusts even harder, chasing his orgasm.
As he reaches the point of no return he forces himself to stay in the moment, to keep his eyes open while taking a mental picture. He sees her in front of him, the love of his life riding him wildly, the beautiful lush green surroundings and smell of vegetation, all heighten the pleasure of his building orgasm.
She feels his hands tighten around her hips and his body stiffen, hears his familiar announcement.
“Oh fuck baby I’m gonna to cum,” he declares as she feels him explode inside her.
She feels every single pulse as he spurts deep into her. For her, nothing in the world comes close to this, the feeling of her husband clinging to her hips, groaning in pleasure as he fills her pussy with cum.
When his last spasm has subsided, they remain locked for a few seconds longer, suddenly aware again that they are out in the open. They quickly look around and both let out a nervous giggle.
“Oh my God baby, that was amazing,” he lets out, realising they have gotten away with it.
She lifts herself off him and hears him draw in his breath as his sensitive cock slips out of her body. She dives silently forward into the water, pulling her bikini panties straight again. As she comes up to the surface she turns around and gives him a devilish smile. He hasn’t moved yet, he’s just looking at her with a look of absolute bliss on his face.
Neither of them would have believed right then, that in less than 20 minutes she would be on her elbows and knees, ass in the air, moaning like a porn star as he pounds her brains out. She loves that familiar slapping sound of skin on skin as he takes her from behind… she loves being fucked like this.
